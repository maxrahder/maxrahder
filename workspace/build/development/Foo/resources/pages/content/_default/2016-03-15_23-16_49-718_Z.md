The +Ext.ux.ajax.SimManager+ class provides a way to serve hard-coded
data for the URLs used by your proxies. The data is provided by +Ext.ux.ajax.Simlet+ objects. 

<pre class="runnable readonly 280">
Ext.ux.ajax.SimManager.register({
    // name:value pairs, where the name is the URL being intercepted
    // and the value is the simlet config.
    "some/url/": {
        type: 'json', // The simlet alias
        data: [] // The data -- it is a hard-coded version of what would be in the feed
    },
    "https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topmovies/limit=5/json": {
        type: 'json', 
        data: {feed: {entry: [{},{}]}}
    }
});</pre>

Note that +Ext.ux.ajax.SimManager+ is in the *ux* package, and
that must be required in `app.json`.
