#Introduction

Ext JS supports *routes*, which is the ability to update and inspect the fragment identifier
in the URL. (The fragment identifier is the information after the # at the end of a URI.) 

We'll update Yelp Extplorer to use route information to save and restore the selected tab, the city and the category.

#Steps


??Specify the route pattern

Edit the main controller and add this entry:

    routes: {
        '!:tab': 'processRoute'
    }

The routes config specifies a series of # patterns. The property is the pattern the framework
looks for, and the value is the name of a controller method.

The +!:tab+ route pattern specifies that if the url fragment identifier looks like `#!map`, then 
the method +processRoute+ is run, with the value after the pattern being passed to the method. 
In other words, a URL ending in `#!map` will result in the string "map" being passed to the 
+processRoute()+ method. We'll use this pattern to identify the tab.
 
The reason we're using the exclamation point in the pattern is to comply with Google's recommendation for
making single page applications searchable by Google. 
See <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/" target="_blank">Google documentation</a> for more information. 

In the controller, add a +processRoute()+ method that takes a single argument named *tab*. For now,
have the method simply log the value of *tab*. 

Save and refresh. Test this by manually adding `#!map` to the URL &mdash; i.e., +/labs/yelpextplorer/index.html#!map+

You should see the word *map* logged in the debugger console. Anything after the `#!` pattern is logged.


??Separate the code using a mixin

In the same folder as the main controller, create a new file named *Routes.js*. 
Use this code:

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.Routes', {
        extend: 'Ext.Mixin'
    });

We're extending from +Ext.Mixin+, which adds some lifecycle features to the mixin class. We're 
not using those, so we don't really need to extend that class, but it's good to know it exists.


??Use the mixin

Edit the main controller, and add this config at the top:

    mixins: ['YelpExtplorer.view.main.Routes'],

This will "mix in" the new class.
 
Save and refresh, and in the debugger's Sources tab, verify that the mixin class is loaded.


??Move the route processing logic

Cut the +processRoute()+ method from the controller and paste it into the routes mixin class.

In this way, we can separate all the routing logic into its own source file.

Save and test by setting a breakpoint in the +processRoute()+ method and typing a matching
route in the url. 


??Process the route information

We want to set the active tab based on the information passed in the route. Containers have a
+setActiveItem()+ method, that takes one of three parameters: an index, a reference to a child
item, or a string that matches an item's +itemId+. We'll use +itemId+.

Edit the tab panel view, and assign an +itemId+ to each item. Set the itemIds to *'map'*, *'grid'*, *'view'*,
and *'chart'*. 

Also give the tab panel +reference:'businessestabpanel'+ &mdash; this is used by the controller to get a reference
to the tab panel.

Now edit the routes mixin and modify the +processRoute()+ like this:

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.Routes', {
    	extend: 'Ext.Mixin',
	    processRoute: function(tab) {
            tab = Ext.Array.contains(['map', 'view', 'grid', 'chart'], tab) ? tab : 'map';
    		this.lookupReference('businessestabpanel').setActiveItem(tab);
	    }
    });

The code sets the tab to a default value, then uses the tab panel reference to look it up, 
and run +setActiveItem()+.

Save and refresh. Test the code by modifying the route information in the browser URL
to be `#!map`,  `#!grid`, `#!view` or `#!chart`.

As you change the value the tab panel should activate one or the other tabs. 


??Update the route as the user changes tabs

For history to work, *you* have to update the route information as the users goes from one tab
to the other. To do this you have to detect tab changes, and update the route accordingly.

Edit the main view, and listen to the tab panel's +tabchange+ and have it run a method 
named +onBusinessesTabChange+. Then edit the routes mixin and add this code:

    onBusinessesTabChange: function(tabpanel, card) {
        this.updateHash();
    },
    updateHash: function () {
        var tab = this.lookupReference('businessestabpanel').getActiveTab().getItemId();
        var hash = '!' + tab;
        this.redirectTo(encodeURI(hash));
    }

The +redirectTo()+ updates the route. We're using a separate +updateHash()+ method, because we'll 
be adding another route in a few steps. 

The +encodeURI+ method is a native JavaScript method that
URL encodes the string. For example, spaces are replaced by *%20*.


??See routes and history in action

Click on the tabs a few times. Every time the URL changes the browser adds it to history.
If you press the back button or forward button, the application should go to the appropriate 
tab. That's because the +processRoute()+ method is run every time the routing information changes.


??Add city history

We'd also like to track changes to the city.

Edit the main controller and add a second pattern to the routes specification: 

    routes: {
        '!:tab': 'processRoute',
        '!:tab/:city': 'processRoute'
    }

In this way, the +processRoute()+ method will be run when either pattern is matched. The 
tab and city are sent as separate parameters. 

From now on, the routes logic will be responsible for setting a default city, so 
edit `app/view/main/MainModel.js` and remove the entry for *city*. Leave the
entry for *category* for now.

Then edit `app/view/main/Routes.js` and replace its contents with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.Routes', {
    extend: 'Ext.Mixin',
    defaultCity: 'Den Haag, Netherlands',
    processRoute: function(tab, city, category) {
        tab = Ext.Array.contains(['map', 'view', 'grid', 'chart'], tab) ? tab : 'map';
        this.lookupReference('businessestabpanel').setActiveItem(tab);

        city = decodeURI(city || this.defaultCity);
        this.getViewModel().set('city', city);
    },
    onBusinessesTabChange: function(tabpanel, card) {
        this.updateHash();
    },
    updateHash: function() {
        var tab = this.lookupReference('businessestabpanel').getActiveTab().getItemId();
        var city = this.getViewModel().get('city') || this.defaultCity;
        var hash = '!' + tab + '/' + city;
        this.redirectTo(encodeURI(hash));
    }
});
</pre>

This is the same as the old code, but it adds a *city* parameter to +processRoute+, and it 
adds an instance member *defaultCity*, which is used in both +processRoute+ and +updateHash+.

Save and refresh, then test it by editing the URL. Change the route to "#!view/austin,texas" and the
application should show the view tab and businesses for Austin, Texas.

??Update the route as the city changes

You also want to update the route as the user types in the city. The tricky part is that you don't want to do it as the user types. Instead, you want to wait until
the user is finished typing. You're already doing that for geocoding with a buffered function. To
both update the routing information and do the geocoding, you need to refactor the controller a little. 
Edit `app/view/main/MainController.js` and replace +initViewModel+ with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly text">
initViewModel: function(vm) {
var me = this;

vm.bind('{typedCity}', Ext.Function.createBuffered(function(city) {
    vm.set('city', city);
}, 1000));
vm.bind('{typedCategory}', Ext.Function.createBuffered(function(category) {
    vm.set('category', category);
}, 1000));

vm.bind('{city}', me.processCity, me);
vm.bind('{location}', me.load, me);
vm.bind('{category}', me.load, me);
},

processCity: function(city) {
    this.geocodeCity(city);
    this.updateHash();
    this.getViewModel().set('typedCity', city);
},
</pre>


Save and refresh, and when you change the city you'll see it in the URL.

??Add routing information for category

  Edit `app/view/main/MainController.js` and add a third +routes+ config that includes category: +'!:tab/:city/:category':'processRoute'+

Then replace the contents of `app/view/main/Routes.js` with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.Routes', {
    extend: 'Ext.Mixin',
    defaultCity: 'Den Haag, Netherlands',
    defaultCategory: 'coffee',
    processRoute: function(tab, city, category) {
        tab = Ext.Array.contains(['map', 'view', 'grid', 'chart'], tab) ? tab : 'map';
        this.lookupReference('businessestabpanel').setActiveItem(tab);

        city = decodeURI(city || this.defaultCity);
        this.getViewModel().set('city', city);

        category = decodeURI(category || this.defaultCategory);
        this.getViewModel().set('category', category);
    },
    onBusinessesTabChange: function(tabpanel, card) {
        this.updateHash();
    },
    updateHash: function() {
        var tab = this.lookupReference('businessestabpanel').getActiveTab().getItemId();
        var city = this.getViewModel().get('city') || this.defaultCity;
        var category = this.getViewModel().get('category') || this.defaultCategory;
        var hash = '!' + tab + '/' + city + '/' + category;
        this.redirectTo(encodeURI(hash));
    }
});
</pre>

This is just like what you had before, but it adds the code to process the category. Note that
the code is handling the default category, so you no longer need to set that in the view model. 
Edit `app/view/main/MainModel.js` and remove the data entry for *category*.

You also need to update the route as the user changes the category, just like you did for city.
Edit `app/view/main/MainController.js` and replace +initViewModel+ with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly text">
initViewModel: function(vm) {
    var me = this;

    vm.bind('{typedCity}', Ext.Function.createBuffered(function(city) {
        vm.set('city', city);
    }, 1000));
    vm.bind('{typedCategory}', Ext.Function.createBuffered(function(category) {
        vm.set('category', category);
    }, 1000));

    vm.bind('{city}', me.processCity, me);
    vm.bind('{location}', me.load, me);
    vm.bind('{category}', me.processCategory, me);
},

processCategory: function(category) {
    this.load();
    this.updateHash();
    this.getViewModel().set('typedCategory', category);
},</pre>

When you're finished, you should be able to change tabs, and type cities and categories, and have
that information included in the URL. And back and next buttons should also work!

 
??Add a default token

Try running your application without a hash mark and routing information in the URL. 
It runs ok, but there's no map and no markers. Once you type in a city or category 
it works ok. That's because your code looks at the routing information, and uses defaults 
for missing items. But if the routing information is completely missing, the routing code
is skipped altogether.

To add default routing information, edit `app/Application.js` and add

        defaultToken: '!map/Madison,WI/coffee',

Use whatever defaults you'd like. Then save, refresh, and re-run your app without using routing information. You
should the defaults being used.
