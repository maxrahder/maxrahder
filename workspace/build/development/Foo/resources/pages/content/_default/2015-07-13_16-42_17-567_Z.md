#Objectives

In this lab, you'll have the list show the contents of the Businesses store.

* Enhance a class to be data-aware
* Show businesses on a list


1. Make the list into a *Ext.List*
    
 Recall from lecture that *Ext.List* is a data-aware component that renders a template
 for each record in a store. 
 
 Edit `app/view/search/List.js` and change the class to extent *Ext.List*. Then modify
 the config:
 <pre>
 config: {
 	itemTpl: [
 		'&lt;tpl if="image_url">&lt;img src="{image_url}" height="50" />&lt;/tpl>',
 		'{name} {[Ext.Number.toFixed(values.distance * 0.000621371, 2)]}'
 	]
 }
 </pre>
 
 Then, edit `app/view/search/Search.js` and modify the list config to use the Businesses store.
 This is identical to how you configured the map. 
 
 Save and refresh, and as you enter search terms and cities, the list of items shown on the map will also be shown on the list!
