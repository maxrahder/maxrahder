#Introduction

In this lab, you'll explore the "Components Tab", and see the wealth of info captured on the components.

#Steps

??Selecting Components
 
The selected components in the component tree will be highlighted in the browser.

Sencha Inspector will also log information about the selected component to your browser’s JavaScript console.

You can additionally reference the most recently selected component in your JavaScript console by typing:

+SenchaInspector.$+

One other helpful feature is ready access to the docs on a selected component.

??The component tree is filterable. 

As you interact with the application, components may be destroyed or modified. Click “Refresh” to synchronize 
the component tree with the current state of the application.

?? Exploring the Component Tree

On the left side you should see all of the components currently available in the application. 
On the right, you’ll see properties, methods, and other information about each selected component.

In most cases, you’ll want to find a specific component in the tree. You can drill-down into the tree 
manually, or search for a component’s ID or xtype using the filter box.

You can even use the pre-defined filters for specific things like finding components with layout problems or 
for finding components that utilize ViewModels, ViewControllers, or Data Binding.

Type a term like tool... or window to filter on that component.

?? Layout issues (and potential issues)

The components that are affected by potential issues, such as overnesting, are highlighted in red.
Hover over the highlighted text to see additional information. You should see a brief explanation about 
why this component reports an error in the layout.

In this particular case, feedlist is a component utilizing a “fit” layout. However, if you clear 
the filter, you’ll notice that its only child is a grid. Sencha Inspector is merely pointing out the 
fact that feedlist is wrapping a grid without adding any additional layout functionality. 
This typically indicates that the grid may be over-nested).

NOTE: Sencha Inspector identifies patterns that may result in known performance or layout problems. 
This does not always mean that a problem actually exists.

?? Filtering VM, VC, and Data Binding

Next, let’s use the filter box to find an instance of *feedpost*. 
Click on the component in the tree, then begin exploring its ViewController.

If you filter the component’s details using the text *“foobar”*, you’ll see fooBar() 
listed under the ViewController panel. You may notice that its color is different 
from other items in the ViewController method list. It appears in green text because 
this method was defined on this class. It would display differently if it had been inherited from a parent class.

Next, clear the filter and open the ViewModel panel. You will notice that several of the properties defined 
on the ViewModel are experiencing errors. For example, “link” has not been assigned a value!

If you open the Data Bindings panel, you’ll see another error. In this case, the value bound to “collapsible” 
is {feeed}. As you can see, this bind is is misspelled, as it should have been {feed}

?? Detail information

On the right, you can inspect the details of the currently selected component. The sections available will 
depend on what’s applicable to the selected component.
- **Properties** lists all configuration for the components
- **Methods** lists all methods that the component supports, including custom methods.
- **Layouts** list layout information for components that support layouts.
- **Data Bindings, ViewModel and ViewController** are generally present in Ext JS 5+ apps in custom views.

??Highlighting

Under Properties, Methods, and ViewController, you may notice some items highlighted in either orange or green.
- **Orange** indicates that this class has overridden inherited functionality.
- **Green** indicates that new functionality has been defined on this class.
- **Non-highlighted** indicates that items have been inherited, but remain unchanged.

?? Data Issues

Under Data Bindings and ViewModel, you may notice some items highlighted in red. 
Red indicates that a problem has been detected with the key/value mapping for that binding.

# Conclusion

In this lab, you used Sencha Cmd to generate a new starter application. 
As we write the YelpExtplorer app, we will refactor this starting point and 
add new views and models. We will also modify the view model and view controller.
