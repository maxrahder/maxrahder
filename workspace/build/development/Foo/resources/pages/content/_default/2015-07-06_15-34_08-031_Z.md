There are a few use-cases for +override+

<div type="expander" caption="To patch bugs in source code you don't maintain" >
<p>
For example, if there's a bug in an Ext JS component method, and on the forums
you find a new method implementation, you'd use <code>override</code> to apply
the new method to your copy of Ext jS. Then in a later release, when the bug is 
officially fixed, you'd remove the override.
</p>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption='To make "hot fixes" in production code' >
<p>You may also use this as a "hot fix" for your own production code!</p>
<p>For example, you can add a `patch.js` to your `index.html`. The patch 
file is normally empty. If you encounter a bug, you can put an override 
with the bug fix in `patch.js` on the production machine. From then on, your
users see the fix. After the permanent fix has been deployed, you'd empty out
`patch.js`.</p>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="To try out new functionality" >
<p>
If you have a feature you want to try out, but don't want to modify the
original class, you can use overrides to replace key methods with your code.
If you then require the override, you'll see your new code in effect.
</p>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="For internationalization" >
<p>
If you code your classes to use properties rather than literals, you can use
override to create internationalized values for those properties.
</p>
<p>
For example, in the French locale file, the "invalid text" value is coded as: 
</p>
<pre>
Ext.define("Ext.locale.fr.form.field.Base", {
    override: "Ext.form.field.Base",
    invalidText: "La valeur de ce champ est invalide"
});</pre>

</div>
