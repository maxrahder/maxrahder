#Introduction

In this lab you'll create a Sencha workspace. Soon, you'll add two applications to the workspace, 
and later you'll write workspace-level and application-level tests. 

#Steps


??Create a workspace

Using a terminal window, navigate to your `SenchaTest/ext-6` folder, and enter:

    sencha generate workspace ../workspace

This creates a Sencha workspace, which is a way to have several applications share one copy
of the Ext JS library. You can also write tests at the workspace-level &mdash; you'll see
how to do that later in class.

??Inspect the workspace folder

In the file system look at the `SenchaTest/workspace` folder. 

Workspaces have this folder structure:

    SenchaTest
        ext-6
        workspace
            .sencha
            ext
            packages
            workspace.json

The `.sencha` folder is hidden, and is normally ignored by developers. It holds meta data used by Sencha Cmd, 
and application builds used by Sencha Test Studio. 

The `ext` folder holds a copy of the Ext JS library. This copy is shared by all applications within the workspace.

The `packages` folder holds code packages. It's empty, initially. 

The `workspace.json` file holds information on the workspace, such as the names of its applications, and the location
of the Sencha Test workspace-level tests.
