#Introduction

In this lab you'll initialize your workspace and add some tests to it. 

#Steps


??Confirm that the server is running

You need Sencha Cmd's build-in server to be running with `SenchaTest/workspace` as the document root. 

If you haven't already done so, use a terminal window to naviate to the `SenchaTest/workspace` folder and
enter +sencha web start+. If you get the error *Address already in use*, that means the server is already
running in another terminal window &mdash; in that case, run `sencha web stop` then `sencha web start`.

The server runs on port 1841.


??Open Sencha Test Studio

Open Sencha Test Studio. On the left you'll see a navigation tree panel showing the workspace and its two nodes:
- Applications
- Tests

The Applications node contains the HitchhikersGuide and Earthquakes applications. The `Tests`
node can hold workspace-level tests.

??Change a Studio preference

Click on the gear icon at the upper right, and look at the preferences. This is where you can set
things like the editor font, network proxies and your Studio licenses.

Within preferences, go to the +General+ tab and de-select *Save all items on leaving application*. If enabled,
this option would save any changes as Sencha Studio *loses focus* &mdash; as you press +Alt-Tab+, for example. In class it's common to tab away 
from Studio as you read instructions, so to prevent prematurely saving changes as you work labs, it's a good idea 
to turn this option off.


??Create a workspace-level project

In Studio, select the `Workspace > Tests` node and click on +Initialize Test Project...+.

??Choose Test type

When the workspace test project is created, Studio also creates a scenario named +Unit Tests+. Set the
scenario test type to *In-browser*. We'll talk about the WebDriver and In-browser test types in a few minutes.

??Set the workspace-level Project URL

Tests are run in a browser window &mdash; that's the runtime environment you're testing against. You
need to specify a Location URL &mdash; that's the URL sent to the browser as your tests start.

With `Tests` selected on the workspace navigation tree, directly under *Project Settings*, enter `localhost:1841` 
as the *Location (URL)*

Save your changes.



??Inspect the workspace

In the file system, look at your `SenchaTest/workspace` folder and note that it now holds a `test` folder. That
folder was created when you initialized the project. The folder will hold test scenarios. The test folder also contains
the file `project.json`, which is maintained by Sencha Studio &mdash; it holds scenario names, paths
and a flag specifying whether the scenario is WebDriver or In-browser.


??Add a test

In the navigation tree, expand `Tests`, then right-click on the `Unit Tests` scenario, choose `New > Jasmine Test Suite` and name the 
suite `MySuite.js`.

This creates the file `workspace/test/unit/MySuite.js` which contains a placeholder
test that passes. The test verifies that 1 is equal to 1, which should pass &mdash; unless there's
something very wrong with your computer. <tt>;-)</tt>

    describe("MySuite.js", function() {
        it("should pass", function() {
            expect(1).toBe(1);
        });
    });

??Choose a browser

In Sencha Studio, with the `Unit Tests` scenario selected, you'll see listed all the browsers on your computer.
Choose Google Chrome. You should see a new browser window open, showing the `workspace` directory.

??Run the test

Under the `Unit Tests` scenario, click the `Run` button on the toolbar to the right. You should see your browser window
refresh as Studio runs the test. After a moment, the results are shown on the right.
