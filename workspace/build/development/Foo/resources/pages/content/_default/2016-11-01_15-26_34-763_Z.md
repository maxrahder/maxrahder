#Introduction

In this lab you'll test the results of selecting a title and an alignment, from the user's perspective.

<!--

Up until now, all tests have been run *in-browser*, but in this lab you'll run the tests using WebDriver.

-->


#Steps

??Rehearse the user interaction

Run the Hitchhikers Guide app in your browser. In this lab you'll use the event recorder to record interactions with
the right-align button and the titles selection button. Try out clicking on the right-align button, followed by choosing *Babel Fish*.

??Create a new test scenario

In Studio, select the `Applications > HitchhikersGuide > Tests` project, and `Add` a scenario named *user* 
in a directory of the same name. Select `WebDriver` for the test type and, on the `Scenarios` side of the pane, set the `Location(URL)` as 
*localhost:1841/HitchhikersGuide*.

<!--

When you've saved, confirm that the scenario is run via *WebDriver* .

-->


??Create a new Jasmine suite

You need a test that verifies that choices from the alignment button and from the title button bring about the proper results.

In the new `HitchhikersGuide > Tests > user` scenario, create a Jasmine test suite named `PageContent.js`.

Since a test engineer won't know much about the source file structure of the app, the file name might match a 
use case name. You can use subdirectories to further organize user tests.

Replace the default contents of `PageContent.js` with this:

<pre class="runnable readonly 120">
describe("Page content", function() {
    it("should reflect the title and alignment", function() {
    
    });
});</pre>


??Record user interaction



Next you need to start and stop the recorder, as a result of which the recorded +play([])+
will automatically be added to the spec. 

Remember: You'll be recording clicking on *right-align* and *Babel Fish*.

In Studio, edit `PageContent.js` and get an insertion point in the body of the
spec. Then click the Event Recorder button in the toolbar.

You'll see the *Chromium* option along with whatever browser pools you may have created.
In this class, you won't create browser pools until later, so you'll only see the Chromium 
option. (Chromium is integrated with Sencha Studio.)


<img src="resources/images/senchatest/EventRecorderClicked.jpg"/>

Select *Chromium*. After a short wait, a new Sencha Studio window opens, running the HitchhikersGuide app in the Chromium browser. 
Click on the right-align button. Then choose *Babel Fish* from the list of titles. 

Switch back to Studio's recorder window, and you'll see that the recorder is updating as you interact with the app.

Stop the recording by clicking `Insert Event Recording`

??Look at the play events

After stopping the event recorder your +play()+ array should look something like this. (The x, y 
coordinates will be different.)

<pre class="runnable readonly 200">
describe("Page content", function() {
    it("should reflect the title and alignment", function() {
        ST.play([
            { type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"fa-align-right\"]", x: 12, y: 15 },
            { type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 119, y: 8 },
            { type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Babel Fish\"]", x: 90, y: 15 }
        ]);
    });
});</pre>

If you used your keyboard to switch from Chrome back to Studio you may see a final
event that looks something like this: +{ type: "type", target: "#titlechoiceview", key: "Meta" }
+. That's the recording of you pressing Command-tab to switch back to Studio. You can delete that
entry.

<b>Important</b>: Note that the selector for the button is +fa-align-right+, but that's incomplete due to a 
limitation in this version of Studio. The selector should actually be +x-fa fa-align-right+. 
Correct the selector to include +x-fa+.

??Add an expected result

To test the results, you need to add a function to the end of the array. For now, just use a 
test that should pass.

<pre class="runnable readonly 240">
describe("Choice.js align and title choices", function() {
    it("should update the page contents", function() {
        ST.play([
            { type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"x-fa fa-align-right\"]", x: 12, y: 15 },
            { type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 119, y: 8 },
            { type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Babel Fish\"]", x: 90, y: 15 }
        ], function(){
            expect(true).toBe(true); 
        });
    });
});</pre>

Run the user scenario, selecting the Chromium browser. The test passes.

??Modify the test to look at the page's text

If you recall, the futures API has methods that wait for component state. One +ST.Component+
method is +contentLike()+ which tests the component's inner HTML against a string or regex. 

The Babel Fish quote includes the text *small, yellow and leech-like*. You need to test for that.

But it's often better to have it fail, and then succeed. Therefore, modify the function's
code and remove the +expect(true).toBe(true)+ and, in its place, use a future to select the view and
test its content:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
describe("Choice.js align and title choices", function() {
    it("should update the page contents", function() {
        ST.play([
            {type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"x-fa fa-align-right\"]", x: 12, y: 15 }, 
            {type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 119, y: 8}, 
            {type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Babel Fish\"]", x: 90, y: 15 }
        ], function() {
            ST.component('quoteview').
            contentLike(/Bullwinkle J. Moose/); // Won't match
        });
    });
});
</pre>

Run the test and it fails with the message *Timeout waiting for content to be like /Bullwinkle J. Moose/*

Now change the regex to look for the correct string: +contentLike(/small, yellow and leech-like/);+ .

Run the test again and it should succeed. Note that the Summary for the test shows the test passing, 
but there are no details below. That's because there's no +match()+ to report on. 
Recall from an earlier lab that tests succeed by default, and only fail if they time
out, or if an +expect()+ matcher fails. 

??Test for alignment too

There is no built-in state watcher for testing the text-align of an element. So you'll 
have to do some low-level DOM coding in the function.

To do that, add an +and()+ to the future and test the contents of the view:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
describe("Choice.js align and title choices", function() {
    it("should update the page contents", function(done) {
        ST.play([
            {type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"x-fa fa-align-right\"]", x: 12, y: 15 }, 
            {type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 119, y: 8}, 
            {type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Babel Fish\"]", x: 90, y: 15 }
        ], function() {
            ST.component('quoteview').
            contentLike(/small, yellow and leech-like/).
            and(function(component) {
                var align = component.body.dom.firstChild.firstChild.firstChild.style.textAlign;
                expect(align).toBe('right');
                done();
            });
        });
    });
});
</pre>

Note the weird-looking statement that looks at the component's DOM. Ironically, test engineers 
can't be expected to know the details of your code, but they *can* be expected to know about 
the DOM. If they use the Chrome degugger to inspect the page, they'll know where the rendered
content is. (The test engineer should check with the programmer to make sure the test is reliable.)

Run the test and it should pass.

??Create multiple instances

The HitchhikersGuide app is coded to show multiple instances of the view. Enable that feature by editing 
`app/view/main/Main.js` and un-comment the +tbar+ config. When you're finished, +Main.js+ will look
like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('HitchhikersGuide.view.main.Main', {
    extend: 'Ext.tab.Panel',
    xtype: 'app-main',
    requires: ['HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.QuoteView'],
    items: [{
        xtype: 'quoteview'
    }],
    tbar: [{
        text: 'New',
        xtype: 'button',
        handler: function(button) {
            var tabPanel = button.up('tabpanel');
            tabPanel.setActiveItem(tabPanel.add({
                xtype: 'quoteview'
            }));
        }
    }]
});
</pre>

Try it by using your browser to run the app &mdash; you can choose quotes and align them, and you can create
new instances of the quote page by clicking `New` in the toolbar. Note that each quote view works independently
of any other, thanks to the beauty of Sencha's Model/ViewModel/ViewController architecture.

??Create a test against two instances

A UI change like this often breaks existing tests, but luckily the recorder uses fairly soft-coded component 
references, so the *should update the page contents* test should still work.

Edit `user/PageContent.js` and add a new spec:

<pre class="runnable readonly 100">
it("should update the page contents on multiple tabs", function() {

});</pre>

Put the cursor in the method body and click `Event Recorder`. Choose Chrome as the browser and, in the
newly spawned window, choose center-align, then the title *Towels*. Then create a second instance with the toolbar `New` button, and 
choose right-align and the title *Freedom*. Then stop the recording. The result should look something like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly 300">
ST.play([
    { type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"fa-align-center\"]", x: 13, y: 19 },
    { type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 120, y: 22 },
    { type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Towels\"]", x: 101, y: 8 },
    { type: "tap", target: "button[text=\"New\"]", x: 29, y: 24 },
    { type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"fa-align-right\"]", x: 18, y: 19 },
    { type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 115, y: 22 },
    { type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Freedom\"]", x: 78, y: 10 }
]);</pre>

As before, change +fa-align-center\+ and +fa-align-right\+ to +x-fa fa-align-center\+ and +x-fa fa-align-right\+ .

??Run it

Even though your new spec doesn't have any tests, go ahead and run it, just to see if it plays.

And... it *fails* with the error *Timeout waiting for target (titlechoiceview[test="Choose a title"])...*

<img src="resources/images/senchatest/TwoQuoteViewFails.jpg"/>

Why? Because the previous spec chose right-align and Babel Fish, so when the second spec ran the
button text wasn't *Choose a title* any more. 


??Clean up code after each spec

It's a good idea to leave the view in its initial state after each spec. You can either do that
by initializing things in +beforeEach()+ or cleaning them up in +afterEach()+. In many cases it's
easier to clean things up at the end, because by that time you don't need futures to select the 
components.

Code an +afterEach()+ to clean up the views:

<pre class="runnable readonly 200">
afterEach(function() {
    Ext.Array.forEach(Ext.all('quoteview'), function(queryview) {
        queryview.getViewModel().set({
            title: 'Choose a title',
            align: 'left'
        });
    });
});</pre>

Now try running the test again.

This time you get past the first error, but another error occurs: *Failed with error "Component Query locator matches multiple items: "button[iconCls="x-fa fa-align-right"]""
*

That's because now there are two buttons that match that selector. 

This illustrates the challenges of testing. Test Engineers will often need to work with developers when writing tests. 


??Clean up the button selectors

Modify the code to select the `New` button, as before, but then get the +id+ of the newly created tab,
and use that in subsequent calls to +play()}+:

<pre class="runnable readonly 300">
it("should update the page contents on multiple tabs", function() {
    ST.play([
        { type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"x-fa fa-align-center\"]", x: 13, y: 19 },
        { type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 120, y: 22 },
        { type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Towels\"]", x: 101, y: 8 },
        { type: "tap", target: "button[text=\"New\"]", x: 29, y: 24 }
        ], function(){
           var id = '#' + Ext.first('app-main').getActiveTab().getId();
           ST.play([
                { type: "tap", target: id + " button[iconCls=\"x-fa fa-align-right\"]", x: 18, y: 19 },
                { type: "tap", target: id + " titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 115, y: 22 },
                { type: "tap", target: id + " menuitem[text=\"Freedom\"]", x: 78, y: 10 }
            ]);
    });
});</pre>


Run the test, and both specs pass.

Note that a more advanced way of handing the issue of ambiguous selectors is by coding a 
custom +ST.locator.Strategy+, and use it via +ST.addLocatorStrategy()+ and +ST.setLocatorStragegies()+.
