<p>
The *classic* toolkit provides a set of components that work with 
older browsers, such as IE 8.
</p><p>
As powerful as Ext JS components are, they can be limited by the 
lack of CSS3 support, or made more complex to code around those
limitations.

<div type="expander" caption="Modern">
<p>
The *modern* toolkit works on modern browsers that support CSS3 and other modern features.
</p><p>
Right now, *modern* means *Touch*, but over time, more and more components 
will be added to allow desktop apps that take full advantage of modern browser features.
