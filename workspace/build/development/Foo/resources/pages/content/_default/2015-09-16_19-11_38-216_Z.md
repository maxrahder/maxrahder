The first known mention of the game was in the book Wuzazu, 五杂俎, 
by the Chinese Ming-dynasty writer Xie Zhaozhi (谢肇淛; ca. 1600), 
who wrote that the game dated back to the time of the Chinese Han 
dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). In the book, the game was called shoushiling
(手势令; lit "hand command").<sup><small>*</small></sup>
