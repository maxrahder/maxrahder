You should use this method if you are planning to use Sencha Inspector during the development phase and especially if you are using Sencha Cmd. If you are using Sencha Cmd, this will also allow you to inspect app theming (Ext JS 6+), which offers a powerful method of dynamic theming.

To configure a development application, you have two options:

- Use Sencha Cmd to run sencha app watch with an additional special flag
- Add a few lines of code to your applicationâ€™s app.json and Application.js files
