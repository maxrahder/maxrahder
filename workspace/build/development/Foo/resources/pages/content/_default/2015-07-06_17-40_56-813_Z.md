Because the CSS file is located in the `build/resources` folder, 
it makes sense that you must build your application first, before you can view your new StyleSheet.

There are many more nice enhancements taking place. 
One is that all of your assets linked from your StyleSheet (Sass), 
will be copied to the `build/resources` folder.
