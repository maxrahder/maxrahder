To set up an archive server, create a file named `storage.json` that holds a set of name-value pairs.
The name is used by users running +stc run+, and the path is the physical location (relative to the 
server root).

<pre class="runnable readonly json 200">
{
    "DeveloperTestResults": {
        "path": "/developers"
    },
    "QATestResults": {
        "path": "/qa"
    }
}</pre>
