#Introduction
 
In this lab you'll use `sencha app watch` to see live updates to a running application.

You'll be changing Sass styles for the `ExtJS_6/classic` app that you generated earlier.

#Steps

??Make sure the server is stopped

Sencha Cmd *watch* starts the server, but you may already have it running. Explicitly stop
the server by opening a terminal window and entering

    sencha web stop

??Start Sencha Cmd *watch*

Navigate to the `SenchaTraining/labs/classic` folder and enter
    
    sencha app watch

??Start Fashion

Use your web browser to run the starter app, using a special URL:

<a href="http://localhost:1841/?platformTags=fashion:true" target="lab">http://localhost:1841/?platformTags=fashion:true</a>

Note the `?platformTags=fashion:true` appended to the url. This starts Fashion.

The application launches more slowly than usual because Fashion is reading all the SCSS. You can see this
by using the debugger to filter network traffic on *scss*.

??Review a couple of concepts

Cmd *watch* automatically detects changes to source or SCSS files and does incremental builds
of the application JavaScript and CSS. Editing and saving `.js` or `.scss` resources triggers 
the incremental build.

With the `?platformTags=fashion:true` parameter, Fashion will also rebuild the CSS *in the browser*.
This is possible because Fashion is written in JavaScript, so it can be run by the browser itself, 
and the results are live.

??Create an SCSS file

Create a new file `ExtJS_6/classic/sass/var/Application.scss`. Without saving, add this code:

    $base-color: red;

Then, while looking at the running app in your Web browser, save `Application.scss` &mdash; after
a moment, the app should reflect the new base color.

??Make another change to the SCSS file

In the running application, select a row. The grid has a listener for *select* that runs 
a controller method that shows an alert to the user. 

<img src="resources/images/ext6/FashionAlertBaseColorRed.jpg"/>

With the alert still visible, edit `classic/scss/var/Application.scss` and change the base color
to green:

    $base-color: green;

Save, and then look at the running app. After a moment, it will reflect the new base color.

#Conclusion

Fashion, used with Live Updates, speeds up the development process, since you don't have to 
re-navigate to the part of the application you're styling. 

Fashion also removes an annoying dependancy on Ruby, and generally speeds up the build process.
Furthermore, Fashion opens the door for Sencha to develop live editing tools to make styling
even easier.
