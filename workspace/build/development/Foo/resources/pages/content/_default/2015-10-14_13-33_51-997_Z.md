To know if it's raining, we'll use *Dark Sky Forecast's* current conditions:

    currently: {
        time: 1444830918,
        summary: "Light Rain",
        icon: "rain",
        precipIntensity: 0.0497, // 0.02 = light, 0.1 = moderate, 0.4 = heavy
        precipProbability: 0.59,
        precipType: "rain",
        temperature: 65.46,
        apparentTemperature: 65.46,
        dewPoint: 62.51,
        humidity: 0.9,
        windSpeed: 0.64,
        windBearing: 348,
        cloudCover: 0.78,
        pressure: 1014.04,
        ozone: 262.88
    }

The *precipIntensity* field shows whether it's raining, in inches per hour. (There's
a request field for changing the units, but we won't bother with it.)
