There are three types of apps. 

- A *classic* app uses *classic* toolkit components
- A *modern* app uses *modern* toolkit components
- A *universal* app has both a *classic* user interface, and a *modern* user interface

Either a classic or modern app will use core classes, such as record definitions,
stores, view controllers and view models.

A universal app allows you to *share* those core classes between a classic and modern view.
