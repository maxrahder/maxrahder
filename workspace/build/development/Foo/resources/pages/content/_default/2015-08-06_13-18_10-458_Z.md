#Introduction

A *dataview* &mdash; +Ext.view.View+ &mdash; renders a template for each record in a store.
We will use a dataview for the business thumbnails on the View tab. Dataviews, like most data-aware
components, publish *selection* &mdash; you'll use this to keep the map and dataview selection in sync.

#Steps

??Add the data view
 
Edit `view/businesses/View.js` and change it so it extends +Ext.view.View+.

Set +itemTpl:'<h1>{name}</h1>'+ and +scrollable:true+.

Then edit the tab panel view, and **bind** the data view to the businesses +store+.

Save and refresh. You should see a list of businesses in the data view.

??Use a stylesheet
 
Open `labs/yelpextplorer/resources/stylesheet.css`. It contains styles you'll use in the dataview.

To use the stylesheet, edit `app.json` look for the +"css"+ array. It will already have one
item, which is the entry for the css needed by the Ext JS components in your app. Add a second
entry to the array:

    "css": [
    {
        "path": "${build.out.css.path}",
        "bundle": true,
        "exclude": ["fashion"]
    },
    {
        "path": "resources/stylesheet.css",
        "bootstrap": false
    }
    ],

Remember, every time you edit `app.json`, you need to do a +sencha app refresh+.


??Use the styles in the data view
 
Edit `view/businesses/View.js` again, and change the template and styling properties like this:

<pre class="runnable 220 readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.View', {
    extend: 'Ext.view.View',
    xtype: 'businessesview',
    scrollable: true,
    itemTpl: '<figure><img src="{image_url}"><figcaption>{name}</figcaption></figure>',
    itemCls: 'businessesview',
    overItemCls: 'over',
    selectedItemCls: 'selected'
});</pre>

Save and refresh. The new +itemCls+, +overItemCls+, and +selectItemCls+ are now used.

??Sync up the business selection with the dataview

We'd like the dataview to reflect the currently selected business, so as you select a business on the
map, it's selected on the data view, and *vice versa*.

To do this, you'll use the data view *selection* property. Edit the tab panel view, and bind the 
view's *selection* property to the view model *{business}*. 

    {
        title: 'View',
        xtype: 'businessesview',
        bind: {
            store: '{businesses}',
            selection: '{business}'
        }
    }

(In an earlier lab you already did this for the map.)
 
Save and refresh, then click on a map marker and look at the view. 
The view selection should be on the same business. Then select an 
item from the view tab, switch to the map tab, and you should see it selected.

??Sort the businesses store
 
When you selected an item on the map, it was a little hard to verify it on the dataview
because the store isn't sorted. Add the config +sorters:['name']+ to the businesses 
store in the main view model:

    businesses: {
        model: 'YelpExtplorer.model.Business',
        pageSize: 20,
        sorters: ['name']
    }

Save and refresh, and the businesses listed in the dataview should be sorted by business name.

# Conclusion

Congratulations! The application now has a map and a dataview which are in sync.
