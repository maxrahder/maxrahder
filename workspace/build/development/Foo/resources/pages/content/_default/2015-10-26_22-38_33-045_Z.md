JavaScript libraries provide some kind of *onready* function, that defers rendering the 
user interface until the page is ready.

In Ext JS, that feature is provided by `Ext.application()`

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.application({
    name: 'MyApp', // The application namespace
    launch: function(){
        // Run when the browser is ready
    }
});
</pre>
