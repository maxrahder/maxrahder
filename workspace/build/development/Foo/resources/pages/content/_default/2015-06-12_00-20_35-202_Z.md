For components, it's better to do initializations in the +initComponent+ method.
The +initComponent+ method is called after the object is created, so all properties 
and their getters and setters will have been initialized. 

<pre class="runnable 260">Ext.define('MyApp.Mammal', {
    extend: 'Ext.Component',
    config: {
        name: 'Anonymous',
    },
    initComponent: function() {
        this.callParent(arguments);
        // Do whatever you need here.
    }
});
</pre>

+initComponent+ is a *component* initialization method. Some other classes have 
similar initialization methods.
