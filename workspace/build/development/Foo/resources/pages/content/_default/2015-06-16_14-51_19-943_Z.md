This property allows you to specify an existing HTML element as the
content of a component. At run time the element is literally moved from its 
original location in the DOM to the component's body. If you had content 
generated with other libraries, you might use +contentEl+ 
to use it within an Ext JS component. 


**index.html**
<pre class="runnable html 90">
<div id="myContent" class="x-hidden">
My Content, hidden from the page.
</div>
</pre>

***.js**
<pre class="runnable 80 readonly">
Ext.create('Ext.Component', {
    contentEl: 'myContent'
});</div></pre>
