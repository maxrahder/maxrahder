#Introduction

In this lab, you'll prepare your computer for the projects ahead and set up your server.

#Steps

<div type="expander" caption="Get the starter code">

Download the <a href="resources/student/labs/earthquakes-starter.zip">Earthquakes starter code</a> and unzip it into
your `labs` folder. When you are finished, the folder will look like this:


    ext-6
    labs
        earthquakes
            app/view
            app.js
            index.html


</div>


<div type="expander" caption="Start the server">

As part of class setup, you installed Sencha Cmd. Cmd has a built-in web server,
which is a handy way to run your apps.

To start the server, open a terminal window and navigate to the `SenchaTraining` folder.
Then, copy and paste this command:

    sencha web start

You should see this message on the terminal console:

    Sencha Cmd v6.0.1.76
    [INF] Starting server on port : 1841
    [INF] Mapping http://localhost:1841/ to ....

This message shows that the terminal window is running the server on port 1841.
The entry for mapping shows that the server's root is the current folder.

The terminal window is running the server, and needs to remain open.
To do other work on the command line you will need to open a new terminal window.

If you need to stop the server, open a new terminal window and enter +sencha web stop+.
You can also close that terminal window or type **Ctrl + C**


</div>


<div type="expander" caption="Run the app">

In your browser, go to <a href="localhost:1841" target="lab">localhost:1841</a>.
You should see the contents of the `SenchaTraining` folder. Select `earthquakes`
and you should see the Earthquakes grid.
