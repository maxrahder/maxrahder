#Introduction

In this lab, you will enable the YelpExtplorer map and see how to code a view model property. You'll also learn how to share classes across projects.

#Steps

??Modify the class path

Right now the map tab is just a panel but it needs to show a Google map and map markers. 
That ability is in a shared class located in `labs/shared/view/Map.js`. To use that you have
to let the class loader know where to look as it loads classes. 

Edit `app.json` and look for the classpath entry. Modify it by adding the path to the shared library:

    "classpath": [
        "app",
        "${toolkit.name}/src",
        "../shared"
    ],

The classpath entry tells the loader where to start looking as it resolves class names. 

Whenever you edit `app.json`, you have to have it re-processed by using your terminal window 
to navigate to your project folder (in this case, your yelpextplorer folder) and running 
`sencha app refresh`. 


??Have the YelpExtplorer Map tab subclass the class in the shared location

Edit `yelpextplorer/app/view/businesses/Map.js` and have it extend +Shared.view.Map+. Remove the +html+ property.

Refresh the browser window and on the Map tab you should see "Please enter search criteria."

??Add the Google Maps library
 
The maps component uses the Google Maps library, so we need to add it to the application.
 
Edit `index.html` and add this script tab at the top of the head section. Make sure you copy and paste the entire 
script tag from beginning to end.

<pre>&lt;script src="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=geometry">&lt;/script></pre>

Save and refresh your browser window. This won't affect the look of application until we try to center the map,
which we'll do later in this lab. But you can verify that Google libraries are being loaded by looking in the 
debugger Sources tab and verifying that libraries under `maps.googleapis.com` are being loaded.


??Test the map's +location+ property
 
The map class has a +location+ property, with a setter and getter. Running +setLocation()+, 
passing an object specifying latitude and longitude, results in the map centering at that
location.

You can try this by refreshing your browser window, and typing this code:

    var map = Ext.first('businessesmap');
    map.setLocation({latitude: 33.6751155, longitude: -95.5316914});

You should see the map center itself on Paris.

??Create a +location+ property
 
Rather than procedurally setting the map center, you'll use a binding.

Edit `app/view/main/MainModel.js` and add the +data+ property:

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel', {
        extend: 'Ext.app.ViewModel',
        alias: 'viewmodel.main',
        data: {
            location: {
                // Bismark, ND          
                latitude: 46.809076,
                longitude: -100.7670546
            }
        }
    });

This creates a view model property named *location* with an initial value. Nothing is 
bound to the value yet, so this won't affect the user interface.

??Bind to the location

You need to have +setLocation()+ run as the view model's location property changes. That's what
bindings do &mdash; they run some setter as a view model property changes.

To bind to the location, edit `app/view/businesses/TabPanel.js` and edit the config for the map:

    {
        title: 'Map',
        xtype: 'businessesmap',
        bind: {
            location: '{location}'
        }
    }

Save your changes and refresh the app. The location is initialized in the view model. That change 
is detected by the binding set up in the map's config, and the bound setter &mdash; +setLocation()+ &mdash; 
will be run. The result is that the application starts with the map centered on Bismark, North Dakota.

??Have location reflect a city

Of course, your users will be entering a city, and not a latitude and longitude. To do this, you'll 
need to detect changes to the city as the user types, and geocode the value.

Edit `app/view/main/MainController.js` and add this method:

    geocodeCity: function (city) {
        var me = this;
        Shared.Geocode.geocodeAddress(city, function (coordinates) {
            if (coordinates) {
                me.getViewModel().set('location', coordinates);
            }
        });
    }

The method uses a singleton class in the shared folder. That means you have to
add +requires: ['Shared.Geocode']+ to the controller. When run, it geocodes the 
city and updates the view model's *location* property.

Save your changes, and test it out by typing this on the debugger command line:

    var main = Ext.first('app-main');
    main.getController().geocodeCity('Uppsala, Sweden');

The map should center on that location. <kbd>:-)</kdb>


??Bind the city and category text fields to view model properties

Edit `app/view/businesses/Filter.js` again, and modify the city and category text fields 
to bind their values to *{city}* and *{category}*:

    items: [{
        xtype: 'textfield',
        fieldLabel: 'City',
        labelWidth: 26,
        bind: {
            value: '{city}'
        }
    }, '', {
        xtype: 'textfield',
        fieldLabel: 'Category',
        labelWidth: 56,
        bind: {
            value: '{category}'
        }
    }],


Then edit `app/view/main/MainController.js` and add this method:

    initViewModel: function (vm) {
        var me = this;
        
        vm.bind('{city}', function (city) {
            console.log(city);
        });
        vm.bind('{category}', function (category) {
            console.log(category);
        });
    }

The +initViewModel+ method is run after the view model. This code will detect changes to the 
city and category, and log the value.

Save your changes and refresh your browser. Then type the name of some city. 
As you type you'll see the name being logged. 

??Geocode the city

The map should be centered at the city entered by the user. But because the view model's city 
property changes *as the user types*, it's impractical to geocode as it changes. Instead, you'll 
set things up to only geocode after the user has stopped typing.

Ext JS has the ability to buffer calls to a function. When you call a buffered function, it will 
only run the original function after the specified time period has elapsed from the last time the 
buffered function was called. 

Modify the +initViewModel+ method like this:

    initViewModel: function (vm) {
        var me = this;

        vm.bind('{city}', Ext.Function.createBuffered(me.geocodeCity, 1000), me);

    }

The binding for category has been removed &mdash; you'll add that back in later when
you start fetching Yelp data.

Save your changes, refresh your browser, and try it out. Enter a city, wait a moment, and the
map should center on that location.
