If we remove the code relating to the record and proxy, the config looks like this:

    store: {
        ...
        sorters: ['timestamp'],
        autoLoad: true,
        ...
    }

The code creates an instance of +Ext.data.Store+. That's the default type for a store,
but you are also free to create your own store class, give it an alias, and create an
instance of that. 

The code also adds a sorter, to sort the data in timestamp order, and it loads the data
as soon as the store is created.

It's common in Ext JS to create an object using an object literal that *describes* the object.
It's also what you're doing in the +items+ array. There, you're creating an instance
of +Earthquakes.view.Grid+ and +Earthquakes.view.Map+.
