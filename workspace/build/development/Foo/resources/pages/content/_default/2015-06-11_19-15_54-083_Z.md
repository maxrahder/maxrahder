* Objects are created via:
 * An alias &mdash; the preferred way
 * +Ext.create()+ &mdash; less often used
* When the object is created, it is initialized using the config 
- Just about any class can have an alias
    - Check the API documentation for the alias prefix
- As a convenience, component aliases can be defined via +xtype+
