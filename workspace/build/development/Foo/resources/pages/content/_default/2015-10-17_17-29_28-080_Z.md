??Add the city text field

Edit `classic/src/view/main/Main.js` and replace the item in the +tbar+
with a text field, whose value is bound to *{displayCity}*.

    tbar: [{
        xtype: 'textfield',
        fieldLabel: 'City',
        labelWidth: 32,
        bind: {
            value: '{displayCity}'
        }
    }],

Save and refresh, and it's already filled with your city! That's because the
view model and controller are shared between the modern and classic views. 

You already coded the logic for *displayCity* in `app/view/main/BaseModel.js` 
and `app/view/main/BaseController.js`, so it's ready to go in the classic view.
