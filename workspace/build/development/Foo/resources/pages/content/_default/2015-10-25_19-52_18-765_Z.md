#Introduction 

In this lab, you'll add routing information to keep track of the actor and movie
that the user chooses. Thus, pressing the browser's Back button will reflect the history
of the user's movie and actor choices.


??Specify the route pattern

The routes config has been placed in `app.view.main.MainController`

    routes: {
        ':actor/:movie': 'processRoute'
    }

Add a +processRoute+ function

    processRoute: function(actor, movie){
        console.log(actor + ' / ' + movie);
    }

Run the movie application using <a href="http://localhost:1841/movies/#steve-mcqueen/the-blob-1958" target="lab">http://localhost:1841/movies/#steve-mcqueen/the-blob-1958</a>

You should see the console log the Trakt IDs for the actor and the movie.


??Separate the code using a mixin

In the same folder as the main controller, create a new file named *Routes.js*. 
Use this code:

    Ext.define('Movies.view.main.Routes', {
        extend: 'Ext.Mixin'
    });

We're extending from +Ext.Mixin+, which adds some lifecycle features to the mixin class. We're 
not using those, so we don't really need to extend that class, but it's good to know it exists.


??Use the mixin

Edit the main controller, and add this config at the top:

    mixins: ['Movies.view.main.Routes'],

This will "mix in" the new class.
 
Save and refresh, and in the debugger's Sources tab, verify that the mixin class is loaded.


??Move the route processing logic

Cut the +processRoute()+ method from the controller and paste it into the routes mixin class.

In this way, we can separate all the routing logic into its own source file.

Save and test by setting a breakpoint in the +processRoute()+ method and typing a matching
route in the url. 

??Process the route information

Edit `app/view/main/Routes.js` and modify the +processRoute+ method

    processRoute: function(actor, movie) {
        console.log(actor + ' / ' + movie);

        this.getViewModel().set('actorName', actor);
        this.getViewModel().set('movieTitle', movie);

    }

Save and refresh, the try a few test URLs:

- <a href="http://localhost:1841/movies/#orson-welles/the-third-man-1949" target="lab">http://localhost:1841/movies/#orson-welles/the-third-man-1949</a>
- <a href="http://localhost:1841/movies/#audrey-hepburn/charade-1963" target="lab">http://localhost:1841/movies/#audrey-hepburn/charade-1963</a>
- <a href="http://localhost:1841/movies/#amy-adams/american-hustle-2013" target="lab">http://localhost:1841/movies/#amy-adams/american-hustle-2013</a>
    

??Update the route as the user chooses the actor

Add a bind in the main controller's +initViewModel+ 

        vm.bind('{actor}', me.updateRoute, me);
        vm.bind('{movie}', me.updateRoute, me);

Then, add the +updateRoute+ method to `Routes.js`

    updateRoute: function() {
        var actor = this.getViewModel().get('actor');
        var movie = this.getViewModel().get('movie');
        if (!(actor && movie)) return;

        this.redirectTo(actor.data.ids.slug + '/' + movie.data.ids.slug);
    }

Save and refresh. Choose a few movies and actors, and look at the URL as do. Press
the browser back button, and the page should process history correctly.
