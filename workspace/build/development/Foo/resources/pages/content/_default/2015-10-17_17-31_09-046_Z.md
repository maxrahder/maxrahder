#Introduction

In this lab, you'll start to display all of the information in the datafeed.

??Create a record class

The data has a timestamp that should be converted to a JavaScript date object. Furthermore, the
*currently* structure is the same as each item in *minutely*, *hourly* and *daily*. The *Dark Sky API* 
calls it a *data point*. 

Create the file `app/model/ForecastDataPoint.js` with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('Umbrella.model.ForecastDataPoint', {
    extend: 'Ext.data.Model',
    fields: [{
        name: 'time',
        type: 'date',
        dateFormat: 'U'
    }]
});

/*
time: The UNIX time (that is, seconds since midnight GMT on 1 Jan 1970) at which this data point occurs.
summary: A human-readable text summary of this data point.
icon: A machine-readable text summary of this data point, suitable for selecting an icon for display. If defined, this property will have one of the following values: clear-day, clear-night, rain, snow, sleet, wind, fog, cloudy, partly-cloudy-day, or partly-cloudy-night. (Developers should ensure that a sensible default is defined, as additional values, such as hail, thunderstorm, or tornado, may be defined in the future.)
sunriseTime and sunsetTime (only defined on daily data points): The UNIX time (that is, seconds since midnight GMT on 1 Jan 1970) of the last sunrise before and first sunset after the solar noon closest to local noon on the given day. (Note: near the poles, these may occur on a different day entirely!)
moonPhase (only defined on daily data points): A number representing the fractional part of the lunation number of the given day. This can be thought of as the “percentage complete” of the current lunar month: a value of 0 represents a new moon, a value of 0.25 represents a first quarter moon, a value of 0.5 represents a full moon, and a value of 0.75 represents a last quarter moon. (The ranges in between these represent waxing crescent, waxing gibbous, waning gibbous, and waning crescent moons, respectively.)
nearestStormDistance (only defined on currently data points): A numerical value representing the distance to the nearest storm in miles. (This value is very approximate and should not be used in scenarios requiring accurate results. In particular, a storm distance of zero doesn’t necessarily refer to a storm at the requested location, but rather a storm in the vicinity of that location.)
nearestStormBearing (only defined on currently data points): A numerical value representing the direction of the nearest storm in degrees, with true north at 0° and progressing clockwise. (If nearestStormDistance is zero, then this value will not be defined. The caveats that apply to nearestStormDistance also apply to this value.)
precipIntensity: A numerical value representing the average expected intensity (in inches of liquid water per hour) of precipitation occurring at the given time conditional on probability (that is, assuming any precipitation occurs at all). A very rough guide is that a value of 0 in./hr. corresponds to no precipitation, 0.002 in./hr. corresponds to very light precipitation, 0.017 in./hr. corresponds to light precipitation, 0.1 in./hr. corresponds to moderate precipitation, and 0.4 in./hr. corresponds to heavy precipitation.
precipIntensityMax, and precipIntensityMaxTime (only defined on daily data points): numerical values representing the maximumum expected intensity of precipitation (and the UNIX time at which it occurs) on the given day in inches of liquid water per hour.
precipProbability: A numerical value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) representing the probability of precipitation occuring at the given time.
precipType: A string representing the type of precipitation occurring at the given time. If defined, this property will have one of the following values: rain, snow, sleet (which applies to each of freezing rain, ice pellets, and “wintery mix”), or hail. (If precipIntensity is zero, then this property will not be defined.)
precipAccumulation (only defined on hourly and daily data points): the amount of snowfall accumulation expected to occur on the given day, in inches. (If no accumulation is expected, this property will not be defined.)
temperature (not defined on daily data points): A numerical value representing the temperature at the given time in degrees Fahrenheit.
temperatureMin, temperatureMinTime, temperatureMax, and temperatureMaxTime (only defined on daily data points): numerical values representing the minimum and maximumum temperatures (and the UNIX times at which they occur) on the given day in degrees Fahrenheit.
apparentTemperature (not defined on daily data points): A numerical value representing the apparent (or “feels like”) temperature at the given time in degrees Fahrenheit.
apparentTemperatureMin, apparentTemperatureMinTime, apparentTemperatureMax, and apparentTemperatureMaxTime (only defined on daily data points): numerical values representing the minimum and maximumum apparent temperatures (and the UNIX times at which they occur) on the given day in degrees Fahrenheit.
dewPoint: A numerical value representing the dew point at the given time in degrees Fahrenheit.
windSpeed: A numerical value representing the wind speed in miles per hour.
windBearing: A numerical value representing the direction that the wind is coming from in degrees, with true north at 0° and progressing clockwise. (If windSpeed is zero, then this value will not be defined.)
cloudCover: A numerical value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) representing the percentage of sky occluded by clouds. A value of 0 corresponds to clear sky, 0.4 to scattered clouds, 0.75 to broken cloud cover, and 1 to completely overcast skies.
humidity: A numerical value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) representing the relative humidity.
pressure: A numerical value representing the sea-level air pressure in millibars.
visibility: A numerical value representing the average visibility in miles, capped at 10 miles.
ozone: A numerical value representing the columnar density of total atmospheric ozone at the given time in Dobson units

Note the definition of *time* &mdash; by specifying +type:'date'+ along with the format string for Unix timestamp,
it will parse the value from the feed into a date object.


The datapoint documentation is at the bottom. 

Since you've just created a class, in your `/labs/umbrella` terminal window, do a 

    sencha app refresh

??Create the store

Edit `app/view/BaseModel.js` and add an entry to the +stores+ config:

    stores: {
        hourly: {
            model: 'Umbrella.model.ForecastDataPoint'
        }
    }

This creates an instance of the default store type &mdash; +Ext.data.Store+ &mdash; whose record type is +Umbrella.model.ForecastDataPoint+..

Since the store will be creating those records, you need to require the class. Add +Umbrella.model.ForecastDataPoint+ to the +requires+ array.

??Load the store

Normally, stores are set up with a reader to automatically create records from the array of values from a feed.
In this case, the forecast contains lots of data we need, like the current conditions, and other forecasts. 

Therefore, when you get the forecast data you'll manually load the *hourly* portion into the store.

Edit `app/view/main/BaseController.js` and add some logic to the +processForecast+ method.

    processForecast: function(data) {
        var vm = this.getViewModel();
        vm.set('forecast', data);
        var store = vm.getStore('hourly');
        store.loadRawData(data.hourly.data);
    }

The code gets the initially empty *hourly* store and loads it with the data from the forecast.

??Make the grid a grid

Edit `classic/src/view/Grid.js` and have it +extend:'Ext.grid.Panel'+

Then, add a +columns+ array with one item.

    Ext.define('Umbrella.view.Grid', {
        extend: 'Ext.grid.Panel',
        xtype: 'umbrellagrid',
        requires: [],
        columns: [{
            text: '&deg;F',
            dataIndex: 'temperature'
        }]
    });


??Bind the grid to the store

Edit `classic/src/view/main/Main.js` and bind the grid's store to the view model's *hourly* store.

    {
        title: 'Grid',
        xtype: 'umbrellagrid',
        bind: {
            store: '{hourly}'
        }
    }

Save and refresh, and you should see one column of values in the grid.

??Make the column a *numbercolumn*

Edit `classic/src/view/Grid.js` and change the column to be +xtype:'numbercolumn'+ with +format:'0'+, center-aligned:

    {
        xtype: 'numbercolumn',
        format: '0',
        text: '&deg;F',
        align: 'center',
        dataIndex: 'temperature',
        width: 50
    }
    
??Add a template column for the conditions icon

In front of the temperature column, add a *templatecolumn* to show the current conditions icon:

    {
        xtype: 'templatecolumn',
        tpl: '<img src="resources/icons/{icon}.svg" height="32">',
        text: 'Conditions',
        align: 'center',
        width: 90
    }

<img src="resources/images/umbrella/TwoColumnsGrid.jpg">


??Add a few more columns

See if you can figure out how to modify the +columns+ array to end up with these additional columns. 
You've already done the columns with the conditions icon and temperature. Give each a +text+ property
for the column header. Experiment with setting widths and the +align+ property to some columns until it looks good.

dataIndex         | xtype              | description  
------            |------------------- |-----------  
time              | datecolumn         | The time, using +format:'F j, H:m a'+
precipProbability | templatecolumn     | The chance of precipitation using +tpl:'{[Math.round(values.precipProbability*100)]}%'+
windSpeed         | numbercolumn       | The wind speed, using +format:'0'+
windBearing       | numbercolumn       | The wind bearing using +format:'0&deg;'+

??The code

Here's what your grid code may have ended up looking like:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('Umbrella.view.Grid', {
    extend: 'Ext.grid.Panel',
    xtype: 'umbrellagrid',
    requires: [],

    columns: [{
        xtype: 'datecolumn',
        format: 'F j, H:m a',
        text: 'Time',
        width: 170,
        dataIndex: 'time'
    }, {
        xtype: 'templatecolumn',
        tpl: '<img src="resources/icons/{icon}.svg" height="32">',
        text: 'Conditions',
        align: 'center',
        width: 90
    }, {
        xtype: 'numbercolumn',
        format: '0',
        text: '&deg;F',
        align: 'center',
        dataIndex: 'temperature',
        width: 50
    }, {
        xtype: 'templatecolumn',
        text: 'Precipitation?',
        width: 110,
        align: 'center',
        dataIndex: 'precipProbability',
        tpl: '{[Math.round(values.precipProbability*100)]}%'
    }, {
        xtype: 'numbercolumn',
        text: 'Wind Speed',
        width: 100,
        dataIndex: 'windSpeed',
        format: '0',
        align: 'center'
    }, {
        xtype: 'numbercolumn',
        text: 'Wind From',
        dataIndex: 'windBearing',
        format: '0&deg;',
        flex: 1
    }]
});
</pre>
