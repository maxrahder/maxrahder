#Introduction

In this lab, you will code the high-level user interface by stubbing
out each view component and using it in the main viewport and tab panel.

#Steps 

??Review the requirements
 
Look at the user's sketch and discuss the key pieces of the user interface.

- Top-docked banner
- Top-docked toolbar used to filter businesses by city and category
- East detail panel
- Center tab panel
    - Map of business location
    - Grid of businesses
    - Data view
 
WARNING: As you create the different classes, keep in mind that that some parts of the application relate to a <i>single</i> business, such as the detail panel and the business model, and some relate to <i>all</i> businesses, such as the grid and the businesses store. That means some class names and xtypes are singular and some are plural.


??Change `Main.js` 
 
Edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and completely replace its contents with this code.
 
<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.Main', {
    extend: 'Ext.panel.Panel',
    xtype: 'app-main',

    requires: [
        'Ext.plugin.Viewport',
    
        'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainController',
        'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel'
    ],

    controller: 'main',
    viewModel: 'main',

    dockedItems: [{
        dock: 'top',
        html: 'banner'
    }],
    layout: 'border',
    items: [{
        region: 'center',
        html: 'businessestabpanel'
    }, {
        region: 'east',
        html: 'businessdetail',
        width: 130
    }]

});</pre>
 
The +dockedItems+ and +items+ define panels at the top, center and east. These panels are 
placeholders for the component classes you'll define during this lab. 

When you save and run, the application should look like this:
<img src="resources/images/yelp/FirstStub.png"> 

Some versions of Cmd create a couple of files unneeded in Yelp. If you have them, delete 
`app/view/main/List.js` and `app/store/Personnel.js`.

Edit `app/view/main/MainController.js` and remove everything other than the +extend+ and +alias+. 
When you are finished it should look like this:
<pre>Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainController', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.ViewController',
    alias: 'controller.main'
});</pre>

Edit `app/view/main/MainModel.js` and do the same thing. When you are finished it should look like this:
<pre>
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.ViewModel',
    alias: 'viewmodel.main'
});</pre>

??Create the banner
    
Create a new file `app/view/Banner.js` with this starter content.
<pre>
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.Banner',{
    extend: 'Ext.panel.Panel',
    xtype: ''
 });
</pre>

<div class="block"><span class="tip content">
Many development environments have ways of saving and reusing starter files. 
For example, in Visual Studio and Eclipse, these are called *templates*, and 
in Sublime Text they are called *snippets*. It's handy to use this feature to 
create a library of commonly-needed class definitions, for things like panels 
and record definitions.
</span></div>
 
Complete the Banner definition by adding three additional configs for the +xtype+, +height+ and
+html+. Here's the finished code:
<pre>
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.Banner', { 
	extend: 'Ext.panel.Panel',
	xtype: 'banner',
	height: 36,
	html: '&lt;img src="resources/images/YelpExtplorerLogo.png" />'
});
</pre>
 
Save your changes.

??Use the new banner class
 
Edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and look for the +dockedItems+ config. Change the top docked item to use 
+xtype:'banner'+, and remove the +html+ config. 

    dockedItems: [{
        dock: 'top',
        xtype: 'banner'
    }],

If you save, and refresh the page, you will see an +Unrecognized class name+ error.
 
The error occurs when you try to create an object when its class is unknown. In this case,
we're trying to create the banner via its alias, but the banner class itself hasn't been loaded. 
 
You need to require any class when your code creates objects via +Ext.create()+ or via an alias. 
That's also true if you reference static properties or singletons. For example, if you had code 
that showed a message box via +Ext.Msg.alert()+, you would need to require that class first.
 
In `app/view/main/Main.js`, add *YelpExtplorer.view.Banner* to its +requires+ array.

Save your change, and refresh the browser window &mdash; you should see the banner.
 
<img src="resources/images/yelp/InitialBanner.jpg">

??Create the tab panel
 
Create the file `app/view/businesses/TabPanel.js`, containing this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define("YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.TabPanel", {
    extend: "Ext.tab.Panel",
	xtype: 'businessestabpanel',
    
    items: [{
	    title: 'Map',
        html: 'businessesmap'
    }, {
        title: 'View',
	   	html: 'businessesview'
    }, {
        title: 'Grid',
        html: 'businessesgrid'
    }]
        
});
</pre>

The class extends *Ext.tab.Panel* and has three items, which for now are just panels with html 
properties &mdash; those are place holders for the view classes you'll create in a couple of steps.

??Use the tab panel
 
Modify the main view's items array to have the center item use the new tab panel xtype. Remove the 
center config's +html+ property. And as usual, you'll need to add the corresponding class name to 
the +requires+ array. 
 
Save and refresh, and your application should run.
<img src="resources/images/yelp/UsingStubbedComponents.jpg">

??Create the tab's view classes
 
Create three files in the `app/view/businesses/` folder:

- `app/view/businesses/Map.js`
- `app/view/businesses/View.js`
- `app/view/businesses/Grid.js`

Now go through the same procedure you did for `Banner.js` by using the 
starter class definition, and modifying them to complete the class names, +xtype+ and +html+:

| Class Name | xtype | html |
| ---------- | ----- | ---- |
| YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.Map |businessesmap | businessesmap |
| YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.View |businessesview | businessesview |
| YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.Grid |businessesgrid | businessesgrid |


Review your code to verify that the package/class names match the path/file names
and that the xtypes are correct.

??Use the tab's view classes

Modify the tab panel to require the map, view and grid classes. 
Also, give each of the three items the appropriate +xtype+. And remove
the +html+ property for the three items.

Save and refresh your browser. 

The application will look the same, but you can verify that the map, view and grid classes are 
being used by looking at the debugger Sources tab, and verifying that the classes are being loaded. 
To verify that the map, view and grid *instances* are being created, enter these statements on the 
debugger console: each should return an object, which is either the map, view and grid.
<pre>
Ext.first('businessesmap')
Ext.first('businessesview')
Ext.first('businessesgrid')
</pre>

??Define the detail panel

We put off creating the detail panel because it's slightly different from the others. In this case,
we will use the view's view model and view controller. Sencha Cmd can create both of these for us.

In the terminal window, navigate to the YelpExtplorer project folder, and type the following.

    sencha generate view business.Detail

Note that the package and class names contain the word business &mdash; singular. That's because it shows details for
a single business.

After running the command, note that three files are generated: a view, a view model and a view controller.

Edit `app/view/business/Detail.js` and set +xtype+ to *businessdetail*. 

??Use the detail panel
 
Modify `Main.js` to require *YelpExtplorer.view.business.Detail*. Also, use the businessdetail xtype 
for the detail item. Remove the detail item's +html+ property.
 
Save and refresh and to the east you should see the the "Hello World!!" used in the generated view.

# Conclusion

Any code or config that creates an object &mdash; such as an item in the +items+ array, or the +viewModel+ 
or +controller+ config &mdash; will have a corresponding entry in the +requires:[]+. That's because
you can't create an instance of some type unless the type itself is loaded.

You also saw that Sencha Cmd generates three source files for every view: the view, the view model and 
the view controller.
