#Introduction

In this lab, you will use Sencha Architect to create an application that reads iTunes data, and shows music video thumbnails and video previews.

Chrome is required to run the application.

## The Application

<img src="resources/images/architect/TunesResult.png"/>

In this lab, you will use Sencha Architect to build an application that shows iTunes music video thumbnails 
for the top 100 music videos and lets the user play the preview video in a popup window.

The information relating to the videos is dynamically fetched using the iTunes data feed, which looks 
like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topmusicvideos/limit=10/json" target="lab">this.</a>

As you can see, the data is complicated. Buried within it is an array of items, each of which represents 
one music video. Within each item are the values we're interested in, but those values are also nested. 
For example, note the location of the music video title, and artist name.

If you ever need to fetch other iTunes feeds, use the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/rss" target="_blank">the iTunes Store RSS Feed Generator</a>.

#Objectives

 - Learn how to build a MVVM application with Sencha Architect
 - Use the following views:
  - An +Ext.container.Viewport+ which is the base container for the application — it sizes the application to take up all available space in the browser window
  - An +Ext.panel.Panel+ which is used for the panel titled "iTunes Music Video".
  - An +Ext.view.View+ which can render HTML content injected with values from a store. This is used for the list of video thumbnails.
  - An +Ext.window.Window+ which is used for the popup window containing the video preview.

- Learn more about ViewModels
- Learn more about ViewControllers
- Learn how to style your application with the Crisp Touch theme

#Steps


??Create a new blank Ext JS project
 
Open Sencha Architect and click the _Create New_ button.
 
On the New Project dialog, choose a basic blank project, and at the top click on the Ext JS framework radio button.
 
Click on _Create_.
 
<img src="resources/images/architect/new.png"/>
 
** Let your instructor describe the key parts of the Architect user interface **
 
* The Toolbox
* The Design Canvas and Code Editor
* The Project Inspector
* The Config panel


??Save and configure the project
 
Choose _File | Save_ and on the Save Project dialog set the `save path` to your web server document root, 
set the `project name` to +tunes+ and set the `App name` to +Tunes+.
 
<img src="resources/images/architect/save.png"/>
 
Click _Save_.
 
After clicking Save, Sencha Architect takes a few moments initializing the project, after which the project settings toolbar button becomes enabled.
 
Click on the Project Settings button on the toolbar. <img src="resources/images/architect/gear.png" height="16"/>
 
Set the `URL prefix` to the location of the new project in your server's web root: `http://localhost/tunes/`
 
<img src="resources/images/architect/settings.png"/>


??Use the Crisp Touch theme
 
In the _Project Inspector_ select the _Resources_ node. 
 
In the _Toolbox_ filter on the word *Crisp* and double-click on *Crisp Touch*. Click _Yes_ when asked to apply this theme.
Since you had selected *Resources*, the Crisp Touch theme is added as a resource.

<img src="resources/images/architect/crisptouch.png"/>


??Add a Viewport
 
In the _Project Inspector_ select the _Views_ node. 
 
Then in the Toolbox, filter on the word _Viewport_, and double-click on the container. Since you had 
selected _Project Inspector > Views_, double-clicking adds the Viewport as its child. Alternately, 
you could have dragged the Viewport onto the Design pane, or onto the Views node in the Project Inspector.
 
In the Project Inspector, select _Views > MyViewport_, and In the Design Canvas, click the flyout gear 
to the right of the viewport and set `layout` to +fit+. We're using fit, because the viewport will have 
a single child &mdash; the iTunes music videos panel &mdash; that takes up all available space.
 
<img src="resources/images/architect/viewport.png"/>


??Add the iTunes Music Videos panel
 
In the Project Inspector select _Views > MyViewport_, then in the _Toolbox_, filter on `panel`. Note that 
several things match "panel", such tab panel and grid panel. Double-click on the `Panel` container, which 
adds it as a child of the viewport.
 
<img src="resources/images/architect/tunes_1.png"/>
 
Then in the Design Canvas double click the panel's "My Panel" title and replace it with the 
title +"iTunes Music Videos"+. This set's the panel's +title+ property.
 
In the Design Canvas, click the flyout gear to the right of the panel and set `layout` to +fit+. 
The panel also uses fit, because it will have one child &mdash; the thumbnails data view &mdash; which needs to 
take up all the available space within the panel.


??Save and preview your application
 
On the toolbar click the *Preview App* button. There's not much there yet. 
You should see the "iTunes Music Videos" title bar. The rest of the window is empty. 
We will add the thumbnails in the following steps.


??Add the thumbnails dataview
 
In the Project Inspector select _Views > MyViewport > iTunes Music Videos_, then in the _Toolbox_, 
filter on `view`. 
 
Under Views, double-click on the *View* component. Double-clicking adds it as the child of the 
panel. (The "View" component is sometimes referred to as a "data view.")
 
Select the view component, and in the Config Panel set `scrollable` to *true*.
 
 
??Describe the iTunes data using a model declaration

In the Project Inspector, select the _[+]_ button and choose `Model`.
 
In the Project Inspector, select the new model, and in the Config panel set `userClassName` to +Tune+.
 
Filter for the `Fields` property and press the _(+)_ to its right. 
An input field will appear. Copy and paste: 
 
<pre>artist,id,image,itunesstore,preview,title</pre>
 
Press Enter. These are the values we're extracting from the data feed.


??Specify where each data value is found within the feed
 
The iTunes feed is complex, with each property buried within other properties. To handle this situation
Ext JS allows you to define a mapping for each field.</p>
 
For each field, first select the field in the Project Inspector (under the Tune model declaration) and
in the Config panel set its <code>mapping</code> property to value specified here. Note that in the Config panel
filter you can type "mapping" and click the lock icon to the right. That will keep you on that property as you
select each field from the Project Inspector.</p>
 
<table>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Mapping</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<p style="margin-top: 0">
<code>artist</code><br/>
<code>id</code><br/> 
<code>image</code><br/> 
<code>itunesstore</code><br/> 
<code>preview</code><br/> 
<code>title</code>
</p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="margin-top: 0">
<code>["im:artist"].label</code>       <br/>
<code>id.attributes["im:id"]</code>       <br/>
<code>["im:image"][2].label</code>    </br>
<code>link[0].attributes.href</code> <br/>
<code>link[1].attributes.href</code> <br/>
<code>["im:name"].label</code>
</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
 
Note that if we had named a field the same as one of the properties we're mapping, like *link*,
the field definition would *overwrite* the value in the field, and the later mappings would no
longer work. So be careful when you use mappings. <kbd>:-)</kbd>


??Add a proxy to the model
 
In the project inspector, choose *Models > Tune*, then in the config panel filter for `Proxy`. 
Click on the _(+)_ icon and choose _JsonP Proxy_.
 
Choose the proxy in the project inspector, then in the config panel set its +url+ property
to +https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topmusicvideos/limit=100/json+.
 
Then, in the config panel, filter for *Reader*, click *(+)* and choose *Json Reader*.
 
In the project inspector, choose the new reader and in the config panel set its `rootProperty` to +feed.entry+. 
The rootProperty specifies the location within the feed where the array of items is found.


??Add a store to hold Tunes records
 
In the Project Inspector, choose _Views > MyViewport > MyViewportViewModel_.
 
In the Config panel, click on the _(+)_ icon next to the +stores+ property and choose *Store*.
 
In the Project Inspector, choose the new store, and in the config panel set three properties:
- Set +model+ to *Tune*
- Set +name+ to *tunes* 
- Set +autoLoad+ on
 
The +autoLoad+ property causes the store to load immediately as it's created. 
 
Once +autoLoad+ is turned on,
you should see an "eye" icon in the Project Inspector, next to the store. If you get an error, 
or don't see the eye, review the steps for coding the model and store. Click on the eye icon and you will see the raw data.

<img src="resources/images/architect/tunes_vm.png"/>
 

??Have the data view show the records
 
In the Project Inspector, find the data view +itemTpl+ property by looking 
under *Views > MyViewport > iTunes Music Videos > tunesView > itemTpl*.
Double-click on *itemTpl*, which opens the Code view.
 
Copy and paste the following HTML snippet and replace the default +Data View Item {string}+ that's there. 
Ext JS can render programmer-defined HTML content and dynamically replace "variables" within the HTML 
with data. These are called *templates*.

    <figure>
        <img src="{image}" />
        <figcaption>&lt;b>{title}&lt;/b>&lt;br/>{artist}&lt;/figcaption>&lt;br/>
    >/figure>


<img src="resources/images/architect/tunes_4.png"/>


??Bind the store to the dataview

In the Project Inspector, select *Views > MyViewport > iTunes Music Videos > MyView*, 
then in the config panel filter for +store+. There is a little gray magnet icon by the property.
Click it to activate binding, then set the property to *{tunes}*. 
<img src="resources/images/labs/architect/itunes/DataviewStoreBind.png" height="150px"/>


??Save and preview the application.

<img src="resources/images/architect/tunes_5.png"/>


??Add a SCSS resource

The video thumbnails in the view are shown as a single column. These would look better with a little styling.

In the Project Inspector, right click the _Crisp Touch_ theme and select _Add SCSS resource_.
 
Use the following styles:
 
<pre class="runnable readonly text">
div.video {
    float: left;
    text-align: center;
    height: 144px;
    padding: 2px 8px 8px 8px;
    width: 132px;
    background: #EDEDED;
    color: #777777;
    opacity:0.6;
    overflow: hidden;
    border: 6px solid #CCCCCC;
    margin: 12px;
 
    figure {
        margin: 8px 0px 8px 0px;
    }
 
    figcaption {
        font-size: 8pt;
    }
 
}
 
div.video.overvideo {
    border: 6px solid #999999;
    opacity:1.0;
    background: #FFFFFF;
    color: black;
}
 
div.selectedvideo {
    border: 6px solid #444444;
    opacity:1.0;
    background: #FFFFFF;
    color: black;
}
</pre>


??Have the data view use the new CSS styles

In the Project Inspector, select the _tunesView_ data view.
 
In the Config View, set the data view +itemCls+ to *video*. (You should immediately see the style in effect in the Design Canvas.) 
Also set +overItemCls+ to *overvideo* and +selectedItemCls+ to *selectedvideo*.



??Save and preview the application

On the Architect main toolbar, press Save, then refresh your browser. You should see your thumbnails flowing from left to right in rows. Each item reflects the styling in the CSS, and each item is highlighted as you mouse over.

Now you need to create the preview window.
 

??Create the preview window

In the Project Inspector, select the *Views* node and in the Toolbar filter for *window* and 
double-click on *Window* to add it as a top-level class.
 
In the Project Inspector, select the new window, and set these config values:
 
* +userClassName:PreviewWindow+
* +autoShow:true+ (checked)
* +height:352+
* +width:640+
* +modal:true+ (checked)
* +resizable:false+ (set the type to boolean, then un-check)
 
Note that autoShow and modal used a checkbox to specify true, whereas resizeable has a type. 
That's because resizable can set set to either the boolean true/false, or to an +Ext.resizer.Resizer+ config.
If you specify the boolean type for the field, the value turns into a checkbox.



??Give the window a template
 
The window uses a template to show the preview video. 
 
In the Config View click the _(+)_ by the +tpl+ config to create an empty template, then click the right 
arrow by the tpl property to open the new template in the Code Editor. Copy and paste this template. The 
template contains a variable, which will be filled with the preview URL from the selected record when 
the window is shown.
 
    <video autoplay preload="auto">
        <source src="{preview}" type="video/mp4">
    </video>

<img src="resources/images/architect/tunes_6.png"/>


??Show the window when the user selects a video
 
We need to show the video preview when the user double-clicks on an item in the dataview.
 
In the Project Inspector, select *Views > MyViewport > MyView*.
 
In the Config panel, filter for *View Controller Event Bindings*, and click on the _(+)_ icon to the right.
 
Choose the +itemdblclick+ event. Then in the project inspector, double-click on the new *onDataviewItemDblClick*
event. This opens the event handler in the view controller.
 
Give the method the following body:
 
    Ext.create('Tunes.view.PreviewWindow', {
        title: record.data.title  + ', provided courtesy of iTunes',
        data: record.data
    });


??Press Save and refresh your browser
 
You should see your completed application! 
It shows iTunes Music Videos thumbnails. 
If you double-click on an item you will see the preview video.
<kbd>:-)</kbd>

<imb src="resources/images/architect/save.png"/>
 
Click _Save_.
 
After clicking Save, Sencha Architect takes a few moments initializing the project, after which the project settings toolbar button becomes enabled.
 
Click on the Project Settings button on the toolbar. <img src="resources/images/architect/gear.png" height="16"/>
 
Set the `URL prefix` to the location of the new project in your server's web root: `http://localhost/tunes/`
 
<img src="resources/images/architect/settings.png"/>


??Use the Crisp Touch theme
 
In the _Project Inspector_ select the _Resources_ node. 
 
In the _Toolbox_ filter on the word *Crisp* and double-click on *Crisp Touch*. Click _Yes_ when asked to apply this theme.
Since you had selected *Resources*, the Crisp Touch theme is added as a resource.
 
<img src="resources/images/architect/crisptouch.png"/>


??Add a Viewport
 
In the _Project Inspector_ select the _Views_ node. 
 
Then in the Toolbox, filter on the word _Viewport_, and double-click on the container. Since you had 
selected _Project Inspector > Views_, double-clicking adds the Viewport as its child. Alternately, 
you could have dragged the Viewport onto the Design pane, or onto the Views node in the Project Inspector.
 
In the Project Inspector, select _Views > MyViewport_, and In the Design Canvas, click the flyout gear 
to the right of the viewport and set `layout` to +fit+. We're using fit, because the viewport will have 
a single child &mdash; the iTunes music videos panel &mdash; that takes up all available space.
 
<img src="resources/images/architect/viewport.png"/>


??Add the iTunes Music Videos panel
 
In the Project Inspector select _Views > MyViewport_, then in the _Toolbox_, filter on `panel`. Note that 
several things match "panel", such tab panel and grid panel. Double-click on the `Panel` container, which 
adds it as a child of the viewport.
 
<img src="resources/images/architect/tunes_1.png"/>
 
Then in the Design Canvas double click the panel's "My Panel" title and replace it with the 
title +"iTunes Music Videos"+. This set's the panel's +title+ property.
 
In the Design Canvas, click the flyout gear to the right of the panel and set `layout` to +fit+. 
The panel also uses fit, because it will have one child &mdash; the thumbnails data view &mdash; which needs to 
take up all the available space within the panel.


??Save and preview your application
 
On the toolbar click the *Preview App* button. There's not much there yet. 
You should see the "iTunes Music Videos" title bar. The rest of the window is empty. 
We will add the thumbnails in the following steps.


??Add the thumbnails dataview
 
In the Project Inspector select _Views > MyViewport > iTunes Music Videos_, then in the _Toolbox_, 
filter on `view`. 
 
Under Views, double-click on the *View* component. Double-clicking adds it as the child of the 
panel. (The "View" component is sometimes referred to as a "data view.")
 
Select the view component, and in the Config Panel set `scrollable` to *true*.
 
 
??Describe the iTunes data using a model declaration

In the Project Inspector, select the _[+]_ button and choose `Model`.
 
In the Project Inspector, select the new model, and in the Config panel set `userClassName` to +Tune+.
 
Filter for the `Fields` property and press the _(+)_ to its right. 
An input field will appear. Copy and paste: 
 
+artist,id,image,itunesstore,preview,title+
 
Press Enter. These are the values we're extracting from the data feed.


??Specify where each data value is found within the feed
 
The iTunes feed is complex, with each property buried within other properties. To handle this situation
Ext JS allows you to define a mapping for each field.</p>
 
For each field, first select the field in the Project Inspector (under the Tune model declaration) and
in the Config panel set its <code>mapping</code> property to value specified here. Note that in the Config panel
filter you can type "mapping" and click the lock icon to the right. That will keep you on that property as you
select each field from the Project Inspector.</p>
 
<table>
<tr><th>Field</th><th>Mapping</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<p style="margin-top: 0">
<code>artist</code><br/>
<code>id</code><br/> 
<code>image</code><br/> 
<code>itunesstore</code><br/> 
<code>preview</code><br/>

</p>
</td>
<td>
<p style="margin-top: 0">
<code>["im:artist"].label</code>       <br/>

<code>link[0].attributes.href</code> <br/>
<code>link[1].attributes.href</code> <br/>
<code>["im:name"].label</code>
</p></td>
</tr>
</table>
 
Note that if we had named a field the same as one of the properties we're mapping, like *link*,
the field definition would *overwrite* the value in the field, and the later mappings would no
longer work. So be careful when you use mappings. <kbd>:-)</kbd>


??Add a proxy to the model
 
In the project inspector, choose *Models > Tune*, then in the config panel filter for `Proxy`. 
Click on the _(+)_ icon and choose _JsonP Proxy_.
 
Choose the proxy in the project inspector, then in the config panel set its +url+ property
to +https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topmusicvideos/limit=100/json+.
 
Then, in the config panel, filter for *Reader*, click *(+)* and choose *Json Reader*.
 
In the project inspector, choose the new reader and in the config panel set its `rootProperty` to +feed.entry+. 
The rootProperty specifies the location within the feed where the array of items is found.


??Add a store to hold Tunes records
 
In the Project Inspector, choose _Views > MyViewport > MyViewportViewModel_.
 
In the Config panel, click on the _(+)_ icon next to the +stores+ property and choose *Store*.
 
In the Project Inspector, choose the new store, and in the config panel set three properties:
- Set +model+ to *Tune*
- Set +name+ to *tunes* 
- Set +autoLoad+ on
 
The +autoLoad+ property causes the store to load immediately as it's created. 
 
Once +autoLoad+ is turned on,
you should see an "eye" icon in the Project Inspector, next to the store. If you get an error, 
or don't see the eye, review the steps for coding the model and store. Click on the eye icon and you will see the raw data.

<img src="resources/images/architect/tunes_vm.png"/>
 

??Have the data view show the records
 
In the Project Inspector, find the data view +itemTpl+ property by looking 
under *Views > MyViewport > iTunes Music Videos > tunesView > itemTpl*.
Double-click on *itemTpl*, which opens the Code view.
 
Copy and paste the following HTML snippet and replace the default +Data View Item {string}+ that's there. 
Ext JS can render programmer-defined HTML content and dynamically replace "variables" within the HTML 
with data. These are called *templates*.

    <figure>
        <img src="{image}" />
        <figcaption>&lt;b>{title}&lt;/b>&lt;br/>{artist}&lt;/figcaption>&lt;br/>
    </figure>

 
<img src="resources/images/architect/tunes_4.png"/>


??Bind the store to the dataview

In the Project Inspector, select *Views > MyViewport > iTunes Music Videos > MyView*, 
then in the config panel filter for +store+. There is a little gray magnet icon by the property.
Click it to activate binding, then set the property to *{tunes}*. 
<img src="resources/images/labs/architect/itunes/DataviewStoreBind.png" height="150px"/>


??Save and preview the application.

<img src="resources/images/architect/tunes_5.png"/>


??Add a SCSS resource

The video thumbnails in the view are shown as a single column. These would look better with a little styling.

In the Project Inspector, right click the _Crisp Touch_ theme and select _Add SCSS resource_.
 
Use the following styles:
 
<pre class="runnable readonly text">
div.video {
    float: left;
    text-align: center;
    height: 144px;
    padding: 2px 8px 8px 8px;
    width: 132px;
    background: #EDEDED;
    color: #777777;
    opacity:0.6;
    overflow: hidden;
    border: 6px solid #CCCCCC;
    margin: 12px;
 
    figure {
        margin: 8px 0px 8px 0px;
    }
 
    figcaption {
        font-size: 8pt;
    }
 
}

div.video.overvideo {
    border: 6px solid #999999;
    opacity:1.0;
    background: #FFFFFF;
    color: black;
}
 
div.selectedvideo {
    border: 6px solid #444444;
    opacity:1.0;
    background: #FFFFFF;
    color: black;
}
</pre>


??Have the data view use the new CSS styles

In the Project Inspector, select the _tunesView_ data view.
 
In the Config View, set the data view +itemCls+ to *video*. (You should immediately see the style in effect in the Design Canvas.) 
Also set +overItemCls+ to *overvideo* and +selectedItemCls+ to *selectedvideo*.



??Save and preview the application

On the Architect main toolbar, press Save, then refresh your browser. You should see your thumbnails flowing from left to right in rows. Each item reflects the styling in the CSS, and each item is highlighted as you mouse over.

Now you need to create the preview window.
 

??Create the preview window
 
In the Project Inspector, select the *Views* node and in the Toolbar filter for *window* and 
double-click on *Window* to add it as a top-level class.
 
In the Project Inspector, select the new window, and set these config values:
 
* +userClassName:PreviewWindow+
* +autoShow:true+ (checked)
* +height:352+
* +width:640+
* +modal:true+ (checked)
* +resizable:false+ (set the type to boolean, then un-check)
 
Note that autoShow and modal used a checkbox to specify true, whereas resizeable has a type. 
That's because resizable can set set to either the boolean true/false, or to an +Ext.resizer.Resizer+ config.
If you specify the boolean type for the field, the value turns into a checkbox.



??Give the window a template
 
The window uses a template to show the preview video. 
 
In the Config View click the _(+)_ by the +tpl+ config to create an empty template, then click the right 
arrow by the tpl property to open the new template in the Code Editor. Copy and paste this template. The 
template contains a variable, which will be filled with the preview URL from the selected record when 
the window is shown.
 
    <video autoplay preload="auto">
        <source src="{preview}" type="video/mp4">
    </video>


<img src="resources/images/architect/tunes_6.png"/>


??Show the window when the user selects a video
 
We need to show the video preview when the user double-clicks on an item in the dataview.
 
In the Project Inspector, select *Views > MyViewport > MyView*.
 
In the Config panel, filter for *View Controller Event Bindings*, and click on the _(+)_ icon to the right.
 
Choose the +itemdblclick+ event. Then in the project inspector, double-click on the new *onDataviewItemDblClick*
event. This opens the event handler in the view controller.
 
Give the method the following body:
 

    Ext.create('Tunes.view.PreviewWindow', {
        title: record.data.title  + ', provided courtesy of iTunes',
        data: record.data
    });


??Press Save and refresh your browser
 
You should see your completed application! 
It shows iTunes Music Videos thumbnails. 
If you double-click on an item you will see the preview video.
