The pluginâ€™s code inspection, done through indexing of classes, packages and other files, enables developers to keep their code clear, organized, and consistent. 

**Preferences > Editor > Inspections > JavaScript > Sencha**

The level of implementation for each of the inspections can be adjusted or disabled entirely.

- Incompatibility between location of classes in file system vs class designation/namespace

- Alerts to any discreprancy in controller handlers specified in view components, can add quick-fix to add them

- Alerts to the omission of `this.callParent()` when implementing `initComponent`
