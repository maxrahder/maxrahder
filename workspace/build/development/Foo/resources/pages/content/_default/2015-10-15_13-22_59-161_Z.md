This method relies on using a “bookmarklet” to setup a connection between the app and Sencha Inspector. You should use this method if you are connecting with an Ext JS or Touch app that is:

- Already deployed
- Not running on a local machine
- Not built using Sencha Command

WARNING: There **are** some drawbacks to using this method. For instance, you cannot use Sencha Inspector to inspect an application’s theme if connecting via bookmarklet.
