#Introduction

In this lab, you'll have the west panel show the current conditions.

Now that you have the geocode class, and can determine a latitude and longitude,
you need a class to fetch the *Dark Sky Forecast* data.

??Create a utility class

Create the file `app/util/Forecast.js` with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('Umbrella.util.Forecast', {
    extend: 'Ext.Base',
    requires: ['Ext.data.JsonP', 'Ext.Deferred'],
    singleton: true,
    urlPattern: 'https://api.forecast.io/forecast/4fb859f323060c5afdea5573f7c99d33/{0},{1}',
    load: function(ll) {
        var deferred = Ext.create('Ext.Deferred');
        if (!ll) {
            deferred.reject('Umbrella.util.Forecast#load() requires a latitude and longitude');
        }
        var me = this;
        var url = Ext.String.format(this.urlPattern, ll.latitude, ll.longitude);
        Ext.data.JsonP.request({
            url: url,
            success: function(data) {
                deferred.resolve(data);
            },
            failure: function(response) {
                deferred.reject('Umbrella.util.Forecast#load() failure');
            }
        });
        return deferred.promise;
    }
});
</pre>

The class is a singleton with a +load()+ method that takes a single parameter, an object holding
the latitude and longitude. The method returns a promise.

Since you've just created a class, in your `/labs/umbrella` terminal window, do a 

    sencha app refresh

??Test the class

Edit `app/view/main/BaseController.js` and add +Umbrella.util.Forecast+ to the +requires+ array. 

Save and refresh, and in the debugger console enter this statement to save a location.

    var ll = {latitude:25.2980569,longitude:91.5735555}; // Likely to be raining

That's the latitude and longitude of Mawsynram, India. It's one of the rainiest places on earth.

Then try the +load()+ method via:

    Umbrella.util.Forecast.load(ll).then(function(data){console.log(data);});

You should see the response logged. Look in the *currently* property.

Try setting the location to Death Valley, California: 

    var ll = ({latitude:36.5870581,longitude:-117.3310695});
    
Then re-run the call to +load()+ &mdash; that result should show dry conditions.

??Use the class to determine if it's raining

Now that you know the forecast class works, you need to use it to show the umbrella in the user interface.
You need to write code that sets the city. In response to that, you need to determine the location. Finally,
you need to load the forecast.

Edit `app/view/main/BaseController.js` and completely replace its contents with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('Umbrella.view.main.BaseController', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.ViewController',
    requires: ['Umbrella.util.Geocode', 'Umbrella.util.Forecast'],

    initViewModel: function(vm) {
        var me = this;

        vm.bind('{city}', function(city) {
            Umbrella.util.Geocode.determineLocation(city).then(function(ll) {
                vm.set('location', ll);
            });
        });

        vm.bind('{location}', function(ll) {
            Umbrella.util.Forecast.load(ll).then(function(data) {
                vm.set('rainy', (data.currently.precipIntensity > 0.001));
            });
        });
    }

});
</pre>

- The view model *{city}* property updates the view model *{location}* property
- When *{location}* changes, it loads the forecast
- When the forecast is loaded, it updates the view model *{rainy}* property

Where are those view model properties coming from? We just made them up. You're free to bind to properties
not yet in use, or push new properties to a view model.

??Set an initial city

For the time being, you can set an initial city by hard-coding it in the view model.

Edit `app/view/main/BaseModel.js` and add the data property +city:'Mawsynram, India'+,
(or use whatever city you'd like). When you are finished, the view model will look something like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly 250">
Ext.define('Umbrella.view.main.BaseModel', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.ViewModel',
    requires: [],

    data: {
        city: 'Madison, WI, USA'
    },
    stores: {},
    formulas: {}
});
</pre>

You can test this by saving, refreshing, and in the debugger console typing:

    Ext.first('main').getViewModel().getData();
    
<img src="resources/images/umbrella/TestDefaultCity.jpg">

??Have the user interface reflect the conditions

*Finally*, we're ready to have the user interface reflect whether it's rainy.

In an earlier lab, you encapsulated +Umbrella.view.Umbrella+ and added a *rainy* property. You
saw that running +setRainy()+, passing true or false, updated the user interface. 

So the current situation is this: You want +setRainy()+ to be run whenever the view model *rainy* property changes. 

You could procedurally run the setter from the controller, but the whole point of the component +bind+ is to 
automatically run a setter.

Edit `modern/src/view/main/Main.js` and bind the umbrella component's +rainy+ property to *{rainy}*. This results in 
the setter &mdash; setRainy() &mdash; being run whenever *{rainy}* is intialized or set. When you are finished the
code should look like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define("Umbrella.view.main.Main", {
    extend: "Ext.carousel.Carousel",
    xtype: 'main',
    requires: [
        "Umbrella.view.main.MainController",
        "Umbrella.view.main.MainModel",
        "Ext.MessageBox",
        "Umbrella.view.Umbrella",
        "Umbrella.view.Location"
    ],
    controller: "main-main",
    viewModel: {
        type: "main-main"
    },

    items: [{
        xtype: 'umbrella',
        bind: {
            rainy: '{rainy}'
        }
    }, {
        xtype: 'location'
    }]

});
</pre>

You can try dynamically changing the conditions via the debugger console:

    Ext.first('main').getViewModel().set('rainy', true); 

or

    Ext.first('main').getViewModel().set('rainy', false);
    
??Try it on your phone

If you have a smart phone, use your development machine's IP address to see how it looks:
You may need to use your hostname.  
On your phone you may need to change location settings to allow the browser to access your location.

??Use your current location

Hard-coding the city is good for testing, but the app needs to be able to set the city based on the user's location.
Doing that is a little convoluted, because the user's exact location won't be the same as the geocoded location for a 
city &mdash; the city's location will be some central location that may differ slightly from the user's location.

But calculating it is pretty easy.

Edit `app/view/main/BaseController.js` and add this function:
 
    useCurrentLocation: function() {
        var vm = this.getViewModel();
        Umbrella.util.Geocode.determineCurrentLocation().then(function(ll) {
            Umbrella.util.Geocode.determineCity(ll).then(function(city) {
                vm.set('city', city);
            });
        });
    } 

Then put an +if+ statement in the +initViewModelMethod+

        if (!vm.get('city')) {
            me.useCurrentLocation();
        }

To test it, edit the base view model and comment out the hard-coded setting for city.
Then, save and refresh. It will take the browser a few moments to determine your location, then the 
call to get the city's latitude and longitude is made, and then the umbrella should appear based on 
your local weather conditions. 

You can confirm what city was used by typing this on the debugger console:

    Ext.first('main').getViewModel().getData();

You should see the value of the view model *{city}* property.

During development, waiting for the browser to determine your location will be annoying, so 
you should re-edit the base view model and put the hard-coded city name back in effect.
