As you saw earlier, Jasmine has a  +spyOn().and.callFake()+ method, which lets you 
replace one method call with another. This is handy for returning mock objects.

<pre class="readonly runnable 180">
// Subsequent calls to Ext.Ajax.request() will return a 404
spyOn(Ext.Ajax, 'request').and.callFake(function(opts) {
    opts.callback(opts, false, {
        status: 404,
        statusText: 'Not found'
    });
});
</pre>

Spies are removed after each spec.
