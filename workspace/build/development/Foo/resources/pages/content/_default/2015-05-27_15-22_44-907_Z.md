#Introduction
 
In this lab you'll create a classic starter application and review its structure.

#Steps

??Generate the starter application

In the terminal window go to the `SenchaTraining/labs/ext/` folder and type this statement:

    sencha generate app --classic Classic ../classic


??Run the application

Now use your Web browser to visit the new application. You'll see the starter app,
styled using the new theme *Triton*.

The Triton theme makes extensive use of the Font Awesome icon font. 

??Look at `app/view/main/Main.js`

The main view is a tab panel, that does a lot of fancy things with the tab bar and header. 
There's also some responsive code, and a lot of binding. 

Most of the tabs simply show *lorem ipsum* text, but the first tab is interesting because it
uses a grid, and the grid creates a store via an alias. 

Store classes have been able to define aliases since version four. The situation doesn't come
up that often &mdash; in this case it's in the starter app because in the universal version the 
store class is shared between the classic and modern parts of the app.

??Look at `app/Application.js`

Note the +onAppUpdate+ method. It's used by the new microloader to let the user know
that new code has been included in the application. 

??Look at `app.js`

The +autocreateViewport+ config has been deprecated. It has been replaced with +mainView+ 
&mdash; a much more logical name.
