#Introduction

In this lab, you'll add a Sass resource to style the Astronauts tab.

??Create the `.scss` file

Create the file `sass/src/view/astronauts/AstronautsView.scss` with this content:

    $itemheight: 50px;
    .astronauts {
        .astronaut {
            height: $itemheight + 20px !important;
            .thumbnail {
                height: $itemheight;
                float: left;
            }
            .name {
                font-size: 1.2em;
                height: $itemheight;
                vertical-align: middle;
                margin: 1em 0 0 3.5em;
            }
        }
    }

This styling contrives to use a variable &mdash; +$itemheight+ &mdash; and it nests styles, to 
give you a flavor of Sass features. In practice, variables would normally go in `.scss` files in `sass/vars`.

The file name is critically important, because a build will only process `.scss` files whose 
file names match a JavaScript source file name.

For example, since you have the file `app/Application.js`, a Sass file named `sass/src/Application.scss` 
would be processed. We're choosing `sass/src/view/astronauts/AstronautsView.scss` for the file name 
containing the styling, because it relates to the component coded in `app/view/Astronauts.js`. 

In fact, nothing prevents you from putting any styling in that file. But matching the names may make 
maintenance easier, because it implies that the styling is intended for that component. And more
importantly, if you were to omit the astronauts view in some version of the app, the corresponding
styling would not be included in the build.

??Process the Sass

Browsers understand CSS, not Sass. Therefore, the Sass source files need to be compiled into CSS. 
That's done via the build process. 

Save your changes.

In a terminal window navigate to `labs/iss` and enter this command:

    sencha app build development

As you recall, a development build creates stylesheets for your app. This includes styling for all 
components, as well as your app-specific styling.

??Use the new styles

Edit `app/view/astronauts/AstronautsView.js` and use the new styles for the component, and the items.

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('ISS.view.astronauts.AstronautsView', {
    extend: 'Ext.dataview.List',
    xtype: 'astronautsview',
    requires: [
        'ISS.view.astronauts.AstronautsViewController',
        'ISS.view.astronauts.AstronautsViewModel'
    ],
    controller: 'astronauts-astronautsview',
    viewModel: {
        type: 'astronauts-astronautsview'
    },
    cls: 'astronauts',
    itemCls: 'astronaut',
    itemTpl: [
        '<tpl if="thumbnail"><img src="{thumbnail}" class="thumbnail"></img></tpl>',
        '<p class="name">{name}</p>'
    ],
    bind: {
        store: '{astronauts}'
    }
});
</pre>

Save and refresh, and the Astronauts tab should show the new styling.
