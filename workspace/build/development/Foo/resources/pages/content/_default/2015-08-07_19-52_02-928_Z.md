At their simplest, a universal app can be coded as two separate apps: one 
in the `classic` folder and the other in the `modern` folder.

Ideally, you would want to refactor it to share view models, view controllers, etc.

The classpath for toolkit is set to `app` and to the toolkit folder. In other words,
code within classic can use classes in `app` and within `classic/src`.
