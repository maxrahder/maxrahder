The classpath in `app.json` is set to this:

        "classpath": "app,${toolkit.name}/src"

What that means is that the code in the classic part of your application can
use classes in both `src` and `classic/src`. Similarly, the modern part of your
app can use `src` and `modern/src`.

Classes in `app` can *only* use other classes in `app`.
