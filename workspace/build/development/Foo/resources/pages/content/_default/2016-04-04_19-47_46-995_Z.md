A test project specifies a default app URL and any additional libraries used by the scenarios within the project.
Typically, each app you're testing has its own Sencha Test project.

On the file system, the project corresponds to a folder named `test`. 

For example, if you were testing things at the workspace level, the test project would reside in 
`workspace/test`. If you were testing an app, the test project would reside in `workspace/myapp/test/`.

Test projects contain test *scenarios*, denoted by the <span style="color: #666666; " class="fa fa-flask"></span>
