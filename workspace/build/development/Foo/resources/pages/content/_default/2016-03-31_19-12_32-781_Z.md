Sencha has the concept of a *workspace*, which is either:

##A Collection of Apps

A workspace can be a collection of apps, all of which share a single install of Ext JS (and other resources).

##A Single App

A single app can be its own self-contained workspace. In this case, the app has its own
copy of Ext JS, kept within the app folder.
