To update an Ext JS app, you simply generate a classic starter app of the same name, and copy
over the `app` folder (and `sass`, if needed). 

As an alternative, you can create a universal app and move the old `app` folder contents to 
`classic/src`.

Entries in `app.json` may need to be manually re-edited.
