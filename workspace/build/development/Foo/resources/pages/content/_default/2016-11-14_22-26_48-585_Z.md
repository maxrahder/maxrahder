Use API documentation or UML diagrams to drive your tests. You should test:

- **Properties**. Confirm that properties are implemented by verifying the existence of set and get methods.
- **Business rules, transformations and side effects**. Are the +update+ and +apply+ methods correctly 
  implemented. For example, 
  if a +name+ property is documented to not allow null values, test it by running 
  its +set+ method, then confirming the result by running the getter.
- **Events**. Confirm that documented events are fired. Within the class these are fired via +fireEvent+. 
- **Published properties** are published and update the view models in the parent container.
- **Any other methods** are tested.
