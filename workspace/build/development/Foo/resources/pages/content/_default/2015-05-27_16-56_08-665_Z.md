    sencha generate app MyApp ../path/to/myapp
    
This generates a universal application, with three key folders:

- `app`, for shared code, such as models or view controllers
- `classic/src`
- `modern/src`

The classic and modern `src` folders are structured like any application, with `model`,
`store` and `view` folders. 

Each toolkit can reference the classes within the toolkit folder, or classes within the
shared `app` folder. A toolkit can not reference classes from the other toolkit.
