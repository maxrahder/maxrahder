<ul>
<li>Test your view class API in isolation
<li>Test *what* the class does, but not *how* it's done.
<li>Tests shouldn't fail if a programmer changes implementation details, but not the API.

<ul>
<li>If your container holds a button, test how you're using it, but don't exhaustively test the button API.
</ul>

<div type="expander" caption="Treat your own classes like they're part of the Ext JS library!">
<li>If you code a view class, test it thoroughly, but then pretend it's part of the Ext JS library. 
<li>Test how your containers use your view, but don't try to test your view's API all over again. 
</ul>
