The +load()+ method causes the store to load its data via its associated proxy. There
are three forms:

<pre>
store.load();
</pre>
<pre>
store.load(function(records, operation, success) {
    console.log('The store has been loaded.');
});
</pre>
<pre>
store.load({params: {schoolid: schoolId}});
</pre>


The last example passes an +Ext.data.Operation+ config
to the load, which allows you to apply properties to 
the proxy before doing the load.
