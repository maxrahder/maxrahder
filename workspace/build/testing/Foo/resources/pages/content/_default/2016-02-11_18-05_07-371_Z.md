End-to-end tests can often be based on *use cases* and *user stories*. 

- A *use case* is typically a detailed description of a user's interaction with a system. Use cases often document user procedures. 
- A *user story* is a higher level description of tasks &mdash; it's an abstration that describes what a user needs, but not 
how they do it.

Regardless of what's used on your project, either can provide a good starting point for tests, because they are a description of
something the system does, along with an expected result.
