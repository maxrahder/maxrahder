There are three key classes in the view:

<div type="expander" caption="The top-level container is a <i>carousel</i>">

style="float:left; margin-right: 1em">
<p>
An +Ext.carousel.Carousel+ is a container that lets the user "swipe" from child to child.
Conceptually, it's a card layout container that uses the user's swipe to change the
active item.
</p>
<p>
The carousel has two items: 
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
<li>A container holding the umbrella images, and 
<li>A form used to explicitly set the city and whether it's raining
</ul>

</p>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="The images container">
<p>
The first child of the carousel is a card-layout container with four items:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
<li>A title bar showing whether to take or leave your umbrella
<li>A load mask, shown as the conditions are being determined
<li>An open umbrella image
<li>A closed umbrella image
</ul>
