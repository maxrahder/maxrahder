#Introduction

In this lab, you'll have the list show the contents of the Businesses store.

#Steps

??Convert the list to an *Ext.dataview.List*
    
Recall from lecture that *Ext.dataview.List* is a data-aware component that renders a template
for each record in a store. 
 
You created *search.List* to be a container. To transform it to be a list, you first need to 
use the Project Inspector to remove the linked reference from *search.Search* cards container. 
Then right-click on *search.List*, then choose `Transform > Ext.dataview.List`

??Configure the list

Since you are now going to have content in this area, the first thing you can do is remove the 
html placeholder text.

Select *search.List* and use the Config Panel and set its *itemTpl* to this value:

    <tpl if="image_url"><img src="{image_url}" height="50" /><p style="text-indent: 5em;"></p></tpl>
{name} {[Ext.Number.toFixed(values.distance * 0.000621371, 2)]}


After setting the template, drag *search.List* back onto the *search.Search* card container.


??Configure the lists's *store* to show all businesses

Select the list linked within *search.Search*. Configure it to use the Businesses store. 
This is identical to how you configured the map. 
 
Save and refresh, and as you enter search terms and cities, the list of items shown on the map will also 
be shown on the list!
