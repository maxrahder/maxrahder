#Introduction

Originally, YelpExtplorer was coded as a classic app, with all view and controller logic
coded together. As a classic app, the source was in the `app` folder. 

In the previous lab you refactored it to be a universal app, and put the logic in the `classic` folder. 
But if all the logic is in `classic`, the modern view won't have access to any of the record classes, 
stores, view controllers and view models.

In this lab you'll refactor the app to put shared logic in the `app` folder.


#Steps

??Review which view model properties are available to the running app

Run the app as a classic app. Then in the debugger console type this:

    Ext.first('app-main').getViewModel().getData();
    
You should see the view model's properties, such as *city*, *businesses* and *ratingCounts*.

Then run the app as a modern app, either by using the debugger's emulation mode and refreshing the browser, or by 
adding +?modern+ to the URL.

In the debugger console re=type this (or press up-arrow):

    Ext.first('app-main').getViewModel().getData();


The call to +Ext.first('app-main').getViewModel().getData()+ evaluates to an empty object. 
Why? Because all the core logic, such as the view model, is coded entirely in `classic`. Nothing 
is being shared with the modern view!

??Review what code can and can *not* be shared

The modern view works a lot like the classic view &mdash; the user can search for businesses 
by entering a city and category, and the results are shown on a map and list. That means
a lot of code can be shared:

- The +YelpExplorer.model.Business+ class
- Most of the view model
- Most of the view controller

But some things are irrelevant to the modern view &mdash; it does not have a chart and it does
not use routing. 

??First, create a shared view controller

Remember, in a universal app the shared code goes in `app`. In this lab step you'll move
the `classic` view controller logic to `app`.

First, create the file `app/view/main/MainControllerShared.js` and copy the contents of 
`classic/src/view/main/MainController.js` into it. 

Second, edit `app/view/main/MainControllerShared.js` and at the start of the +Ext.define()+ 
rename the class from +MainController+ to +MainControllerShared+. Remove the +alias+ config
completely.

You also need to remove the logic that relates to routing: 
- Remove the +mixins+ config
- Remove the +routes+ config
- Remove the two statements that run +this.updateHash()+

Finally, replace the contents of `classic/src/view/main/MainController.js` with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainController', {
    extend: 'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainControllerShared',
    alias: 'controller.main',

    mixins: ['YelpExtplorer.view.main.Routes'],

    routes: {
        '!:tab': 'processRoute',
        '!:tab/:city': 'processRoute',
        '!:tab/:city/:category': 'processRoute'
    },

    initViewModel: function(vm) {
        this.callParent(arguments);
        vm.bind('{city}', this.updateHash, this);
        vm.bind('{category}', this.updateHash, this);
    }

});</pre>

Why did you remove the alias? Because when the main view creates the controller via the alias, 
you want it to create an instance of `YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainController` &mdash; that
class extends the shared controller, so you'll still get the shared features.

You left the routes logic in `classic` because that code is specific to the classic view.

Since you moved things around a lot, it's important to do an *app refresh* to let the bootstrap 
figure out where your classes are. Use a terminal window, and from the `labs/yelpextplorer/` folder
run

    sencha app refresh

Then refresh your browser window. The app should run the same as it did before. If you look at the Sources tab
in the debugger, you'll see that the controller in `yelpextplorer/app/view/main` is being used

??Make the view model shared

You need to do something similar for the view model. 

First, create the file `app/view/main/MainModelShared.js` and copy the contents of 
`classic/src/view/main/MainModel.js` into it. 

Second, edit `app/view/main/MainModelShared.js` and at the start of the +Ext.define()+ 
rename the class from +MainModel+ to +MainModelShared+. Remove the +alias+ config
completely.

Thirdly, replace the contents of `classic/src/view/main/MainModel.js` with this code:

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel', {
        extend: 'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModelShared',
        alias: 'viewmodel.main'
    });

And finally, since the model references the +Business+ record, you need to move that too. 
Create an `app/model` folder and move `classic/src/model/Business.js` there.

Save your changes and do a +sencha app refresh+. Then refresh your browser and make sure
everything is still running ok.

??Have the modern user interface use the shared code

You have been working on the classic view &mdash; now you're working on modern. Be careful
to edit in `modern/src`.

Edit `modern/src/view/main/MainController.js` and have it extend the shared controller:

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainController', {
        extend: 'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainControllerShared',
        alias: 'controller.main-main'
    });

Do the same for `modern/src/view/main/MainModel.js`: 

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel', {
        extend: 'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModelShared',
        alias: 'viewmodel.main-main'
    });


Save your changes and use a terminal window to do a +sencha app refresh+.

Then run the app as a modern app via debugger emulation, or by adding +?modern+ to the URL.
If you then run +Ext.first('app-main').getViewModel().getData();+ in the debugger console, you'll 
get the shared view model back, with the properties *businesses* and *ratingCounts*. And if 
you look at the debugger's Sources tab you'll see that the shared controller and view models
are being loaded.

??Share fewer things!

But wait a minute... The modern view sees the *ratingCounts* store, but that's only used by the classic
view, so there's no need to share that.

Edit `app/view/main/MainModelShared.js` and cut the *ratingCounts* store definition, and place it
within `classic/src/view/main/MainModel.js`.

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel', {
        extend: 'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModelShared',
        alias: 'viewmodel.main-main',
        
        stores: {
            ratingCounts: {
                type: 'array',
                fields: ['rating', 'count']
            }
        }
        
    });

The code that updates the store is in the shared controller, so you need to move that too. Cut the +onBusinessesRefresh+ 
method from the shared controller, and paste it into `classic/src/view/main/MainController.js`.

The +onBusinessesRefresh+ method has the code that populates the *ratingCounts* store. But note that 
it's invoked via the listener in the *businesses* store config in the view model. The view model is shared, but 
the +onBusinessesRefresh+ should only be run in the classic view. Therefore, remove the +listeners+ config in 
`app/view/main/MainModelShared.js`, and add code to the classic view controller to procedurally listen to the 
load event:

    initViewModel: function(vm) {
        this.callParent(arguments);
        vm.bind('{city}', this.updateHash, this);
        vm.bind('{category}', this.updateHash, this);
        vm.getStore('businesses').on('load', this.onBusinessesRefresh, this);
    }


If you save your changes, refresh your browser and re-type +Ext.first('app-main').getViewModel().getData();+
you should see the *businesses* store, but not the *ratingCounts* store.
