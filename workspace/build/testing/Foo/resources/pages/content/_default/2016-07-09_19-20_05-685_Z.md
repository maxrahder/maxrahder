Sencha Test includes a library that makes it easier to test Ext JS applications. The library uses the +ST+ 
namespace, and is available within any test project. With it, you're not limited to using Jasmine and plain JavaScript. 

The ST API makes it easy to select components, test their state, and simulate user interaction.
