You need to do a build in order to see your application styling.

<div type="expander" caption="<code>sencha app build production</code>">
Creates *minimized* javascript and CSS files. Both are optimized to include only the JavaScript and CSS needed by your
application. For example, if you aren't using a tree panel, then the tree panel class and tree panel styling
is *not* included in the build. After doing a production build your development application will use the
optimized CSS.

<div type="expander" caption="<code>sencha app build testing</code>">
This is an optimized build, like a production build, but the javascript and CSS files are not minimized.
After doing a testing build your development application will use the
optimized CSS.
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="<code>sencha app build development</code>">
A development build isn't really a build at all! It's a way of having your development application
use `ext-all-rtl-debug.js` and use both your styling as well as styling for all components. That means 
when developing your app, your classes are always dynamically loaded and any library component you use 
will be styled.
