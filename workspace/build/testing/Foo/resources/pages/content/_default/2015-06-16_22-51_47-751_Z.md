When your code requests a listener for a mouse event, the framework attaches 
a similar touch or pointer event as needed. 

<pre class="runnable readonly 200">
// If you code this...
myElement.on('mousedown', someFunction);

// On touch devices, it automatically becomes this...
myElement.on('touchstart', someFunction);

// On pointer devices, this automatically becomes...
myElement.on('pointerdown', someFunction);
</pre>

In most cases, the framework can transition seamlessly between mouse, touch, and pointer input. 
However, there are a few mouse interactions, such as mouseover, that do not translate easily. 
Such events need to be handled on an individual basis.
