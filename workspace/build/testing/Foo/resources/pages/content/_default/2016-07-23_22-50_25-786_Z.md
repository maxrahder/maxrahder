#Introduction

So far you've only been writing workspace-level tests, but more typically you'll be writing tests for a 
specific application. In this lab you'll initialize the Hitchhiker'sGuide app and do unit-testing in it.

You'll create a test suite and a stubbed-out class. Then you'll run the test suite and see that all tests fail. 
Then, one by one, you'll implement the code until all tests pass.


#Steps

??Review the requirement

The HitchhikersGuide application needs a utility class, which will encrypt the quotations. 
Later, you'll add a feature to the application that allows the user to toggle between the encrypted 
output and the normal quote. 


??Look at the +Encrypt+ API

You will implement +HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt+ as a singleton with two methods: +toNSA+ and +toGCH+.

+toNSA()+ will encrypt the specified string using a simplified 
version of the US National Security Agency (NSA) encryption algorithm UG-323-17Z, in which 
the first syllable onset is moved to the end of the word, and appended with *ay*. For 
example, *pizza* becomes *izzapay*.

+toGCH+ will encrypt the specified string using an algorithm created by the UK Government Communications 
Headquarters signals intellegence division (GCH-SIGINT), in which *ub* is inserted after each syllable 
onset. Thus, *pizza* becomes *pubizzuba*.

??Initialize the Hitchhiker's Guide app in Studio

In Studio's nagivation tree, select `HitchhikersGuide > Tests` and, on the right, 
click `Initialize Test Project...`.   When it's done initializing, select the `In-browser` test type for the `Unit Tests` 
scenario before saving your selection.

Initialization does two things: 

- Studio overwrites `app.json` and adds a new property for configuring tests 
- Studio creates the `test` folder at the root of the project


??Stub out the test

Create the Jasmine test suite `util/Encrypt.js` by opening the `HitchhikersGuide` test project, selecting
the `Unit Tests` scenario, right-clicking to create a new Jasmine test suite, and entering `util/Encrypt.js`. 
(By using the full path and file name &mdash; with a slash &mdash; Sencha Studio will add 
`Encrypt.js` under the folder `util`.)

Use this code for the test suite:

<pre class="runnable readonly 300">
describe("Encrypt", function() {
    it("encrypts using the GCH-SIGINT algorithm", function() {
        expect(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.toGCH('pizza')).toEqual('pubizzuba');
    });
    it("encrypts using the NSA algorithm", function() {
        expect(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.toNSA('pizza')).toEqual('izzapay');
    });
});</pre>


The code has one spec that tests +toGCH+, and another that tests +toNSA+.
For now, you're only testing against a single word. Later you'll add more thorough tests.

Select the `Unit Tests` scenario and choose a browser &mdash; Studio will show a dialog
saying it needs to do an initial build. Select `Yes`.

<img src="resources/images/senchatest/HitchhikersInitialBuild.jpg"/>

This build is secretly kept in `.sencha/temp/Earthquakes/classic/index.html` &mdash; that URL is shown in 
Studio, by the scenario's +Location (URL)+. If you were to look in the `app.js` at that location, you'd
see that it contains +Ext.require('Earthquakes.*');+, which results in all application classes being loaded
on launch. That means your tests are free to use app classes without needing to write your own +requires+.




??Stub out the encryption class

Create the file `HitchhikersGuide/app/util/Encrypt.js` containing this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly 260">
Ext.define('HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt', {
    singleton: true,

    toNSA: function(s) {
        return '';
    },
    toGCH: function(s) {
        return '';
    }

});</pre>

Note that the class API is established, but the methods are un-implemented. 
With test-driven development, the code implementation comes *after* the test 
is written. 

??Run the test and see it fail

With test-driven development, the test is *supposed* to fail initially, because
the code implementation comes *after* the test is written. It's test *driven* 
development.

Run the test in Sencha Studio, and note that the two Encrypt specs fail.

??Implement +toGCH+

Using your source code editor, edit `HitchhikersGuide/app/util/Encrypt.js` and implement
the +toGCH+ method. Here's the +Encrypt+ class, with the GCH-SIGINT algorithm:

<pre class="runnable readonly text 320">
Ext.define('HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt', {
    singleton: true,
    firstVowelRx: /[aeiou*]/i,
    allVowelsRx: /[aeiou*]/ig,
    allWordsRx: /\w\S*/g,
    allSpecialCharsRx: /[^a-zA-Z ]/g,

    toNSA: function(s) {
        return '';
    },

    toGCH: function(s) {
        return s.replace(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.allWordsRx, function(word) {
            return word.replace(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.allVowelsRx, function(syllable) {
                return 'ub' + syllable;
            });
        })
    }

});
</pre>


Rerun the test and the GCH-SIGINT spec should pass!


??Improve the test

In Sencha Studio, edit `HitchhikersGuide > Tests > Unit Tests > util > Encrypt.js` and 
improve the GCH-SIGINT spec. Replace the spec with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly text 160">
    it("encrypts using the GCH-SIGINT algorithm", function() {
        expect(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.toGCH('pizza')).toEqual('pubizzuba');
        var string = 'The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things';
        var expected = 'Thube Hubitchhubikuber\'s Gubuubidube tubo thube Gubalubaxy hubas uba fubew thubings';
        expect(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.toGCH(string)).toEqual(expected);
    });
</pre>


Run the test again, and the newly added GCH-SIGINT expectation should also pass.

??Implement +toNSA+

The NSA algorithm is more complex. Replace the contents of +toNSA+ with this code. 

<pre class="runnable text readonly 320">
toNSA: function(s) {
    var result = '';
    s = s.replace(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.allSpecialCharsRx, "");
    var words = s.match(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.allWordsRx);
    Ext.Array.forEach(words, function(word) {
        if (word.length < 4) {
            result += word;
        } else {
            word = word.toLowerCase().replace(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.allSpecialCharsRx, "");
            var i = word.indexOf(word.match(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.firstVowelRx)[0]);
            word = word.substr(i) + word.substr(0, i) + 'ay';
            result += word;
        }
        result += ' ';
    });
    return result;
}
</pre>

Run the test suite, and it fails with the message `Expected "izzapay " to equal "izzapay"`. If you
read carefully you'll see that the actual value has a space in it, which is a bug. 

In test-driven development it's common for code to fail during initial testing &mdash; you need to 
enhance the code until all tests pass.


??Fix the bug

Edit `HitchhikersGuide/app/util/Encrypt` and change the +return+ statement in +toNSA+ to be +return result.trim();+
That will strip off trailing spaces. 

Rerun the test and it should pass. 


??Improve the test

In Sencha Studio, edit `HitchhikersGuide > Tests > Unit Tests > util > Encrypt.js` and 
replace the NSA spec with this, which adds an improved expectation:

<pre class="runnable readonly text 180">
it("encrypts using the NSA algorithm", function() {
    expect(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.toNSA('pizza')).toEqual('izzapay');
    var string = 'The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things';
    var expected = 'The Itchhikershay Uidegay to the Alaxygay has a few ingsthay';
    expect(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.toNSA(string)).toEqual(expected);
});</pre>

Try the test, and it fails! 

The NSA algorithm is supposed to preserve capitalized words. In otherwords,
the capitalized word *Hitchhiker* should encrypt as *Itchhikerhay*. 

<img src="resources/images/senchatest/NsaFails.png" height="400" />

??Fix the bug

Upon inspection, you see that there is no logic that detects whether a given word 
starts with a capital letter. Replace the +toNSA+ method with this corrected code:

<pre class="runnable readonly text">
toNSA: function(s) {
    var result = '';
    s = s.replace(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.allSpecialCharsRx, "");
    var words = s.match(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.allWordsRx);
    Ext.Array.forEach(words, function(word) {
        if (word.length < 4) {
            result += word;
        } else {
            var firstChar = word.charAt(0);
            var isProper = (firstChar === firstChar.toUpperCase());
            word = word.toLowerCase();
            var i = word.indexOf(word.match(HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.firstVowelRx)[0]);
            word = word.substr(i) + word.substr(0, i) + 'ay';
            if (isProper) {
                word = word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.substr(1);
            }
            result += word;
        }
        result += ' ';
    });
    return result.trim();
}
</pre>

Run the tests again, and they should all pass! <tt>:-)</tt>
