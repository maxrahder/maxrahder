#Introduction

You can see businesses on the map tab, and business thumbnails on the view tab.
Now you'll add a grid of businesses on the grid tab. You'll use the grid's *selection*
to keep it in sync with the map, dataview and detail panel. And we'll have the grid
use a chained store in order to allow it to be sorted independently of the other store.

#Steps

??Add the grid

Edit the grid view, and change it so it extends +Ext.grid.Panel+. 

Add a columns array with four items:

    columns: [{
        text: 'Name',
        dataIndex: 'name',
        width: 120
    }, {
        xtype: 'templatecolumn',
        text: 'Rating',
        dataIndex: 'rating',
        tpl: '<img src="resources/images/stars_{rating}.png">'
    }, {
        text: 'Reviews',
        dataIndex: 'review_count',
        width: 60,
        align: 'right'
    }, {
        xtype: 'templatecolumn',
        text: 'Address',
        tpl: '{[values.location.display_address.join(", ")]}',
        flex: 1
    }]

Remove the old +html+ property.

Since the grid columns use two column types, you need to require them. Add
+requires: ['Ext.grid.column.Column', 'Ext.grid.column.Template']+
 
Grids need a +store+, so edit the tabpanel view and bind the grid to the businesses store.

Save and refresh, then look at the grid. You should see businesses listed.

??Have the grid sync its selection with the rest of the application
 
Like comboboxes and data views, grids also have a *selection* property. Edit the tab panel
view and bind the grid's *selection* property to *{business}*, just like you did for the 
view tab.

When you're finished, you should be able to select items on the map, grid or data view, 
and have the other components kept in sync.

??Use the Ext.ux package
 
We're going to use the rating widget, but before we can we have to include the package that has
the rating widget class. 

To use the ux package, edit `app.json` and look for the +requires+ array. It holds an array of strings
&mdash; each is the name of a required package. 

- If you are using Ext JS 5, add *"ext-ux"* to the array. 

- If you are using Ext JS 6, add *"ux"* to the array.

Save your changes, and use Sencha Cmd to do a `sencha app refresh`. This updates `bootstrap.js` to 
reflect the change to `app.json`.
 
Since the *Ext.ux* package includes styling, you also need to including the styling
by using Sencha Cmd to do `sencha app build development`. We'll talk about that command in
more detail on the last day of class.

??Use the rating widget

Rather than using an image for the stars rating, let's see how the rating widget looks.

For a reminder of widget columns, you can look at <a href="classicAPI#!/api/Ext.grid.column.Widget" target="api">the API documentation</a>.

Replace the template column with an +xtype:'widgetcolumn'+ and verify that the +text+ and +dataIndex+ properties
are still set to +text:'Rating'+ and +dataIndex:'rating'+.

Widget columns also need a +widget+ config. Set it to:

    widget: {
    	xtype: 'rating',
	    rounding: 0.5,
    	minimum: 1, // Yelp ratings go from 1 - 5
	    maximum: 5,
    	selectedStyle: 'color: #ff4444',  // Pale red
	    overStyle: 'color: #ff0000' // Red
    }

You also need to modify the requires array to use the new components being used in the grid:

    requires: [
        'Ext.grid.column.Column', 
        'Ext.grid.column.Widget', 
        'Ext.ux.rating.Picker', 
        'Ext.grid.column.Template'
    ]

Save and refresh the browser window, and you you should see the rating widget in the grid.

Note that changes to the rating are live! 

??Use deep binding to detect changes to a record's data
 
As you change a business' rating, look at the detail panel. Is it **not** updating as you change the 
rating, even though it's bound to the record. 
 
The reason it doesn't update is that the bound value is only updated when the property references
a different object. In other words, as you change the business selection, *{business}* references 
different businesses, so the detail panel's +setData()+ method is run. But as you change the rating, 
you're changing a *property* of the record. From the perspective of
the detail panel, it's the *same* business record, so +setData()+ is not run.
 
To detect changes to the bound object's *properties*, you need to specify a deep binding. 

Edit the main view and modify the detail panel's binding:

    {
        region: 'east',
        xtype: 'businessdetail',
        bind: {
            // data: '{business}'
            data: {
                bindTo: '{business}',
                deep: true
            }
        },
        width: 130
    }

Save your changes, refresh and change the rating for a business. As it changes, you should see the detail 
panel change.

??New requirement &mdash; sort the grid independently of the dataview
 
Run the application, go to the grid, and sort it. Then look at the data view.
It reflects the sort. That's because they share the same store, and sorting 
is done in the store, not in the view.

Our users noticed this too, and have asked us to have the data view remain in 
alphabetical order, regardless of how grid columns are sorted.

To do this, we need to configure a *chained store* in the main view model, and 
have the grid use it.

This is pretty simple:

    sortableBusinesses: {
        source: '{businesses}'
    }

Now edit the tab panel view and bind the new store to the grid. 

Save and refresh, and try it out. You can sort any grid column, and the dataview is not affected. +:-)+



# Conclusion

The application now has a grid, and you used a chained store to allow the grid to be sorted independently.
