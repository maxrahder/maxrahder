#Use the Overrides Folder for Ext JS Overrides

- Applications generated with Sencha Cmd have an `overrides` folder
- Use this folder to override Ext JS classes
- These are automatically processed, without the need for +requires+
- To enable this, add +app.overrides=${app.dir}/overrides+ to `.sencha/app/sencha.cfg`

For more information on the overrides folder, read Don Griffin's blog
