For example, +Ext.Date+ contains this code:

<pre>Ext.Date.dayNames : [ "Sunday", "Monday", ..., "Saturday" ]</pre>

The German local file contains this code:

<pre>Ext.Date.dayNames = [ "Sonntag","Montag", ..., "Samstag" ];</pre>

If the German locale file is loaded after the Ext JS library is loaded, then those 
values are in effect.
