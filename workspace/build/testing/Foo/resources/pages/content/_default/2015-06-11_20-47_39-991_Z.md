So when should you create a class, versus create the instance in-line?

<div type="expander" caption="When to Create a Class">
<ul>
<li>When the config becomes complex or heavily nested
<li>For reuse, when multiple instances are needed
<li>If the class needs methods
<li>If you need to define extra configs or properties
</ul>
</div>

Or, said another way...

<div type="expander" caption="Advantages of a Class">
<ul>
<li>Isolates complexity, and is easier to maintain
<li>Reusable
<li>Can be tested in isolation
<li>Can have new configs and properties
<li>Can have methods and a view controller
</ul>
</div>
