Spec callbacks that include a +done+ parameter are not completed
until +done()+ is called. This lets you run tests after doing async calls. 

<pre class="runnable readonly">describe("Async", function() {

    it("a", function(done) {
        expect(true).toBe(true);
        setTimeout(function() {
            expect(true).toBe(true);
            done();
        }, 1000);
    });

    it("b", function() {
        // This spec isn't run until the previous spec is done.
        expect(true).toBe(true);
    });

    it("c", function() {
        // Error: Async c' has no expectations
        // Exception: 'expect' was used when there was no current spec, this could be because an asynchronous test timed out
        setTimeout(function() {
            expect(true).toBe(false);
        }, 1000);
    });

    it("d", function(done) {
        // Exception: 'expect' was used when there was no current spec, this could be because an asynchronous test timed out
        setTimeout(function() {
            expect(true).toBe(false);
        }, 6000); // This is longer than the 5 second default
    });


});
</pre>
