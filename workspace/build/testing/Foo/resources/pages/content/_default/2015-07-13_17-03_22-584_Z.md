#Objectives

In this lab, you will show details on a business when the user taps on a 
map marker or taps on a list item.

* Listen to an event
* Use a navigation view
* Render details using a template


1. Detect map select events
    
 The shared map class fires the *select* event when an item is tapped.
 Edit `app/view/search/Search.js` and this listener to the map config:
 
 <pre>
 listeners: {
    select: function(list, coordinate) {
        alert(coordinate.record.data.name);
    }
 }
 </pre>
 
 Save and refresh, and you should see the alert showing the business name. The *coordinate*
 holds a refrence to the business because of the way you implemented *updateMarkers* in the
 *YelpTouch.view.search.Map* class.

1. Turn the Search container into a navigation view
 
 You are going to show the detail panel when a business is selected. By changing the Search
 container to a navigation view, you can do that by running *push*. 
 
 Edit `app/view/search/Search.js` and change the class to +extend:'Ext.navigation.View'+.
 
 Remove the container's +layout:'fit'+ config. Be careful: remove the *layout* on the Search class
 items array, and *not* the layout on the nested card-layout container.
 
 Then, remove the config for the toolbar from the +items+ array. Rather than using a regular toolbar,
 you are going to customize the navigation view toobar vis this config:
<pre>
 navigationBar: {
     ui: 'light',
     items: [{
         xtype: 'searchtoolbar',
         itemId: 'toolbar',
         ui: 'light',
         listeners: {
            select: function(tb, page) {
                tb.up('search').setPage(page);
            }
          }
     }]
 }
</pre>
 
 Now modify the map's listener:
 <pre>
 listeners: {
     select: function(map, coordinate) {
         map.up('search').push({
             xtype: 'searchdetail',
             data: coordinate.record.data
         });
     }
 }
 </pre>
 
 This code pushed the detail page onto the navigation view. The detail panel is still stubbed out,
 for now it will just show the panel's *html* property &mdash; *searchdetail*
 
 Save and refresh, then tap on a map marker. The detail page should slide into view.

1. Make the toolbar bar look a little better
 
 You probably noticed that the toolbar doesn't look very good as the detail page slides in.
 That's because a navigation bar adds a Back button to the toolbar, and it's already so crowded
 that the addition of the new button doesn't look good.
 
 You will change the code to hide the search toolbar as the detail is shown.
 
 Edit `app/view/search/Search.js` and add a listener to its config:
 <pre>
 listeners: {
     push: function(view) {
         view.down('#toolbar').hide();
     },
     pop: function(view) {
         view.down('#toolbar').show();
     }
 }
 </pre>
 
 This code will hide the search toolbar as the detail page slides in, and show it when the
 user presses back.

1. Enhance the detail panel
 
 Edit `app/view/search/Detail.js`. Modify the config to look like this:
 <pre>
 config: {
 	padding: 8,
 	tpl: [
 	'&lt;h1>{name}&lt;/h1>'
 	]
 }
 </pre>
 
 Save and refresh, then tap a map marker. You should see the business name on the detail panel.
 
 Now use this more complete template:
 <pre>
 config: {
 	padding: 8,
 	tpl: [
 		'&lt;h1>{name}&lt;/h1>',
 		'&lt;h2>{display_address}&lt;/h2>',
 		'&lt;tpl if="image_url">&lt;img src="{image_url}"/>&lt;/tpl>' 
 	]
 }
 </pre>

1. Have the list drill-down too
 
 Edit `app/view/search/Search.js` and add a listener to the list config. Just copy and paste the *listeners*
 config from the map. Then, modify it, because the *select* event fired by a list is passed different parameters: 
 the first is a reference to the +list+, and the second is the selected +record+. Modify the code accordingly,
 then save and refresh. After you do a search, tap on List, then choose an item. The detail panel should slide
 in, showing the selected business.
