- They provide proof that code meets user requirements
- Tests constitute technical requirements &mdash; which is handy for code handoff or code reviews
- The cost of a bug can be huge, and involve liability
- It's much much cheaper to fix bugs early in the development lifecycle
- A good test approach allows *regression tests*, which let you re-run suites of tests, and thus insure that routine "unrelated" code maintenance doesn't break anything
- Well tested code, following continuous integration practices, can be released at almost any time
