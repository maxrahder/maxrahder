To use Selenium, visit <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/" target="_blank">the Selenium web site</a> 
and download the Selenium Standalone Server, in addition to the drivers for the browsers you want to test against. 

You start the server via the command line, using the version number of the downloaded server.

+java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.52.0.jar+


By default, the server starts on port 4444.
