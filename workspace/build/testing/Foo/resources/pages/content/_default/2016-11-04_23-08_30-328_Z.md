Sencha libraries work with any server, but for class, you'll use the Jetty server that comes with Sencha Cmd.

Start Jetty by opening a terminal window prompt, navigating to the `SenchaTraining` folder and typing

    sencha web start 

After starting Jetty, you should see something like the following in the terminal window.

    sencha web start
    Sencha Cmd v6.0.2.14
    [INF] Starting server on port 1841
    [INF] Mapping http://localhost:1841/ to ....
    


WARNING: Once you've started Jetty, you will need to leave the terminal window open and running.
