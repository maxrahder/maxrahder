If making direct AJAX or JSONP calls is so easy, why even bother with records and stores?

<div type="expander" caption="Use records and stores if you need their functionality">
<ul>
<li>Record fields can convert feed values
<li>Records can be validated
<li>Stores can be sorted and filtered
<li>There are methods for creating, updating or deleting records
<li>There are methods for sending record and store data can be sent to the back-end
<li>Stores can be used with grids and other components
</ul>
</div>
