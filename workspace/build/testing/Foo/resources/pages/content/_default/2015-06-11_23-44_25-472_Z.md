Naming conventions for classes are documented in the 
excellent <a href="classicGuides/core_concepts/classes.html#Naming_Conventions" target="api">Class System Guide</a>
in the API documentation. It pretty much follows what you've seen in other languages:

- In general, all class names are capitalized and camel-cased: +MyClass+
- Application names are capitalized and camel-cased: +MyApp+
- Package names are all lower-case letters: +mypackage+
- Component xtypes are all lower-case letters, dashes are ok: +mypackage-myview+
- Properties and methods start with a lower-case letter and are camel-cased: +myProperty+
- Don't use under-scores
- Method names should be verbs: +go()+
- Properties (and config properties) should be nouns: +thing+
