The application has:

- A top-level viewport that holds a map and a grid
- A *select* event on the map, handled in a view controller
- A record definition describing the data and proxy
- A shared store, defined in the viewport's view model
- Two-way binding, with the *selection* from the map and grid being bound to the same property
