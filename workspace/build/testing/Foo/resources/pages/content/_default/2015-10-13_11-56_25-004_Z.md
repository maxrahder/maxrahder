The plugin also looks to speed up the development process with the ability to create boiler plate frequently used Ext JS constructs like classes and packages with comments and optional keyboard shortcuts to encourage speed of execution, consistency of implementation and a reduction in errors. 


##Adding New Project, Classes or Packages:

    Class, View, ViewModel, ViewController, Model, Controller, Store

This can be accomplished by either:

**Creating a new workspace:** 
 
    File > New Project > Ext JS Workspace

**Creating a new project:** 
 
    File > New Project > Ext JS App
    
select themes when creating a Universal Ext JS 6 App

**Creating a new class (controller, model, store, view, viewController, viewModel):**

    File > New Project > Ext JS App

Easiest to right click on the folder you want to nest new items in and choose New...
    
**Creating a new package:**
 
    File > New > View Package

Right-clicking on a project tree to accomplish the same

Can create a folder containing an integrated `MVVM` collection complete with +alias+ references and extensions.
