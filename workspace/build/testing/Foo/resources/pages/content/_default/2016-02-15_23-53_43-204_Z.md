There are several +ST+ methods that return an +ST.future.Element+, an +ST.future.Component+, or 
a component-specific sub-class. 

Think of the name as *some time in the future you'll get the component you're interested in.*

Once you have the future object, you can run methods to test or change its state, then do 
additional processing such as run a Jasmine expectation. 

Note the convenience syntax; +ST.button+, for example, is equivalent to +ST.future.Button+.

<pre class="runnable readonly">
describe("My button", function() {
    it("should be disabled", function() {
            
        // BAD
        // Ext.first('#mybutton') will return undefined because when the app launches
        // the button doesn't exist until milliseconds later.
        expect(Ext.first('#mybutton').isDisabled()).toBe(true);
        
        // GOOD 
        // The call to ST.button('#mybutton') waits until the button exists before
        // making the call to disabled(), which in turn waits until the button is
        // disabled. If the button never exists, or if it is never disabled, the calls
        // time out, and the test fails.
        ST.button('#mybutton').
        disabled();
        
    });
});</pre>
