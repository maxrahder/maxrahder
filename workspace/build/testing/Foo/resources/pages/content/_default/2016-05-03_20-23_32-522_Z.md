Don't use the +done+ param if you aren't doing async processing. And if you *do* use it, 
make sure you actually call it!

<pre class="runnable readonly 250">
describe("Async", function() {

    it("times out if you don't call done()", function(done) {
    
        expect(1).toBe(1); // This passes

        // Jasmine will fail this spec because done() is never called

    });

});</pre>
