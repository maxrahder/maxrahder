To package your Ext JS app with a certain language file, 
edit app.json and add two entries:
- Require *ext-locale*, which is the Sencha 
locale package that includes all languages
- Name a specific local via the +"locale"+ setting

<pre>
"requires": [
    "ext-locale"
],
"locale":"nl"
</pre>

As usual, after changing `app.json` file, you need to do a `sencha app refresh`
