The iTunes data is weird. And one strange aspect is that it's heavily nested with objects. 

Here's part of an entry. The location of the artist's name is in the 
object's *['im:artist'].label* property, and the song title is in *title.label*

    [{
        "im:artist": {
            "label": "Justin Bieber",
        },
        "title": {
            "label": "What Do You Mean? - Justin Bieber"
        },
        ...
