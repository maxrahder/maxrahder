In practice it's hard to create a completely isolated test, especially when testing
components. Components will often have view models, view controllers, or nested
components. 

Therefore, the term *unit test* is used for very simple, non-UI, tests, such as tests
against a utility class, or tests against model classes.

Any UI test is called an *integration* test, whether it's a test of a single
class, or a test of several classes.
