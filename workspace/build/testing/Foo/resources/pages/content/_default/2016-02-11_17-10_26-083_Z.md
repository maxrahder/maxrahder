Sencha Test consists of two applications: 

- Sencha Studio &mdash; a desktop application used to organize and run tests, and
- Sencha Test Command-line (STC) &mdash; a command-line tool that can be integrated with your continuous integration system

The applications use two key features:

- The *Test Runner* &mdash; used to run the tests suites
- The *Archiver* &mdash; which stores automated test results
