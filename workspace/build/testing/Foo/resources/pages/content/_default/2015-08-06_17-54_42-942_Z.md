#Introduction

In this lab, you'll add a bar chart showing the distribution of star ratings.

#Steps

??Review the requirements

The users have asked us to add a bar chart showing the distribution of the ratings of a  
set of businesses. In other words, it will show how many businesses have a 5 star 
rating, how many have a 4 star rating, and so forth. 

To do this, you'll use the Sencha charts package. One additional challenge is that the
feed does *not* include this summary information, so we'll have to calculate it on the fly.


??Use the Sencha Charts package

In your browser window that's running Yelp Extplorer, look at the debugger's Sources tab and 
notice the `ext/packages/` directory being loaded. Those are the packages Yelp Extplorer is using,
such as sencha-core and the theme package. 

To use the charts package, edit `app.json` and look for the +requires+ array. It holds an array of strings
&mdash; each is the name of a required package. 

- If you are using Ext JS 5, add *"sencha-charts"* to the array. 

- If you are using Ext JS 6, add *"charts"* to the array.



Whenever you make changes to `app.json` you have to have Sencha Cmd re-process the file by running
+sencha app refresh+. Run the command, and after it finishes refresh the browser window. Then look at
the debugger's Sources tab again. You should see the `ext/packages/sencha-charts/` or the `ext/packages/charts/`package being loaded.

??Create the charts class

Create the file `app/view/businesses/RatingCounts.js` using this starter code:

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.RatingCounts', {
    	extend: 'Ext.panel.Panel',
    	xtype: ''
    });

Give it +xtype:'businessesratingcounts'+.

Then edit the tab panel view. Add a fourth tab titled *Ratings* and use the new xtype. Since this code 
creates an instance of the new class, it needs to be loaded &mdash; update the +requires+ array accordingly.
 
If you save and refresh, you should see the new tab, but there's nothing in the tab yet, because there's no data.

??Set up the chart series
 
Now change `RatingCounts.js` and change the ancestor class to +extend:'Ext.chart.CartesianChart'+.

Add the required classes:

    requires: [
        'Ext.chart.series.Bar',
        'Ext.chart.axis.Numeric',
        'Ext.chart.axis.Category'
    ]

And add the series and axes: 

    series: [{
        type: 'bar',
        xField: 'rating',
        yField: 'count'
    }],
    axes: [{
        type: 'numeric',
        position: 'left',
        title: 'Count',
        minimum: 0
    }, {
        type: 'category',
        position: 'bottom',
        title: 'Rating'
    }]


??Calculate the rating counts

We'll manually populate a store as the filtered businesses change.

First, configure a new store in the main view model:

    ratingCounts: {
	    type: 'array',
	    fields: ['rating', 'count']
    }

This defines an *array store*, which is just a store preconfigured to use an +Ext.data.reader.Array+.

Next, in `MainModel.js`, add a listener on the *businesses* store, so that the *load* event runs a controller
method named *onBusinessesRefresh*. 

In `MainController.js`, code the method like this:

    onBusinessesRefresh: function(store) {
        var rawData = {};
        store.each(function(school) {
            var rating = school.data.rating.toString();
            rawData[rating] = rawData[rating] || 0;
            rawData[rating]++;
        });
        var data = [];
        Ext.Array.forEach(["1", "1.5", "2", "2.5", "3", "3.5", "4", "4.5", "5"], function(item) {
            data.push([item, rawData[item]||0]);
        });
        this.getStore('ratingCounts').setData(data);
    }

The code sets up an object to holds the counts, then loops through the set of businesses and 
increments the count for the star rating of each business.

Then the code loops again over the set of all possible ratings in order to get the data in the right order, 
and to make sure there's an entry for every possible rating. 

Finally, it updates the store with the data.


??Bind the chart to the store

Now open the tab panel view and bind the rating counts component to the +ratingCounts+ store.

Save, refresh, and take a look. You should see the bar chart.

# Conclusion

You coded a bar chart using the Sencha charts package. You also used an +Ext.data.ArrayStore+.
