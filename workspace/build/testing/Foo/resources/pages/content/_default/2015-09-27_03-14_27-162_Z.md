There are only two classes in the application. 

Imagine if there were scores of classes. 

On a large application, it's difficult to maintain a set of scripts in the right order, 
but Ext JS handles that for you &mdash; it has a class loader that dynamically fetches 
classes as they are needed. 

- Add +requires:['Earthquakes.view.main.Main']+ to `app.js`
- Add +requires:['Earthquakes.view.Grid']+ to `app/view/main/Main.js`

Then, remove the scripts loading `Main.js` and `Grid.js` from `index.html`.
