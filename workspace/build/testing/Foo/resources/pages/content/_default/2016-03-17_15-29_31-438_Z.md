In the last lab you comparied many properties in the record against expected values. 
That's a fairly common use case, but Jasmine doesn't have a "toHaveMatchingProperties" 
matcher. 

However, Jasmine *does* provide an easy way to provide your own custom matchers. 

<pre class="runnable 430 readonly">jasmine.addMatchers({
    // Returns true if each property in expected is equal to the corresponding value in actual.
    toHaveMatchingProperties: function() {
        return {
            compare: function(actual, expected) {
                for (var key in expected) {
                    if (actual.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
                        if (actual[key] !== expected[key]) {
                            return { pass: false, message: '["' + key + '"] was ' + actual[key] + ', but was expected to be ' + expected[key] };
                        } else {
                            // Keep looping
                        }
                    } else {
                        return { pass: false, message: '["' + key + '"] was not present, and was expected to be ' + expected[key] };
                    }
                }
                return { pass: true, message: 'The expected properties match the actual properties.' };
            }
        };
    }
});</pre>
