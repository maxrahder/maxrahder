The most significant change in Ext JS 6 is the inclusion of Touch components! 
You can now have a single code base that includes both desktop and touch components.

- Each library is called a *toolkit*
- Ext JS components are now called *classic*
- Touch components are called *modern*

There are also enhancements to various components, a new theme, and a new component &mdash; the
Pivot grid.
