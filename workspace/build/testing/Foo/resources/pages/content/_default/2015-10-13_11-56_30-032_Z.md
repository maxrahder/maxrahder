As work on an application progresses, it is commonplace to encounter scenarios that require the renaming and/or repositioning of files within the file structure of a project. 

When that happens, the filenames and locations can fall out of sync with the namespaces and names of the classes themselves, causing the app to fail to function.

The plugin strives to eliminate the likelihood of this occuring by alerting the developer to inconsistencies of either the naming or placement of files by:  

- preserving namespace fidelity with the directory structure

- moving files accordingly
 
- renaming/updating related files accordingly

- updating the new names and namespaces in any referenced requires and uses arrays

EXPERIMENT: Create a subfolder called +test+ under +store+ and move the file +Personnel.js+ there. Upon saving, observe the prompts.
