The server must return a structured response. +total+ is the total number of records for all pages. +data+ are
those records corresponding to the page/start and count parameters.

<pre>
{
    success : true,
    total : 10932,
    data : [ {}, ..., {} ]
}
</pre>

NOTE: This means you need to specify a proxy reader since the record array is nested in the response.
