Spies monitor &mdash; or *spy on* &mdash; function calls. 
This is accomplished via +spyOn(object,methodName)+, which creates an
interceptor function that's run whenever the method is called. You can then 
run tests to see when and how the function is called.

What does it mean to intercept a call? Here's a simple example. Jasmine's spy 
mechanism does something similar, but with more options and variations.

<pre class="runnable">
var o = {
    getFoo: function(){
        return 'foo';
    }
};

alert(o.getFoo()); // Alerts 'foo'

intercept(o, 'getFoo', function(){return 'bar'});

alert(o.getFoo()); // Alerts 'bar'



function intercept(object, fnName, fn){
    object[fnName] = fn;
}</pre>
