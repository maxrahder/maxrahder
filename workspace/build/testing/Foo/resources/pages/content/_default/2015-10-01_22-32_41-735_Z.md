#Introduction

In this lab, you'll make the main view a tab panel, with three tabs which will eventually hold the map, 
list of ISS passes, and astronauts.

??Make the main view a tab panel and add the tabs

Edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and change the class to extend +Ext.tab.Panel+. Add +tabBarPosition: 'bottom'+ to the class config.
then edit the +items+ array to use the +itemCls+ *x-fa fa-crosshairs*, *x-fa fa-list-ul* and *x-fa fa-users*. When you are finished,
`Main.js` should look like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('ISS.view.main.Main', {
    extend: 'Ext.tab.Panel',
    xtype: 'main',
    tabBarPosition: 'bottom',

    items: [{
        xtype: 'component',
        html: 'Map goes here',

        title: 'Map',
        iconCls: 'x-fa fa-crosshairs'

    }, {
        xtype: 'component',
        html: 'Passes goes here',

        title: 'Passes',
        iconCls: 'x-fa fa-list-ul'

    }, {
        xtype: 'component',
        html: 'Astronauts go here',

        title: 'Astronauts',
        iconCls: 'x-fa fa-users'

    }]
});
</pre>

Note that for now, each item is an +Ext.Component+, but later you'll change each one to use the xtype of the 
map component, passes component or astronauts component, which you'll be creating in subsequent labs.

The +html+ property is usually used as a placeholder &mdash; with it, you'll see where the map, passes and astronauts
lists will go.


??Try it out

Save your changes and refresh the browser. You should see three tabs, and selecting each one should show the tab's *html* value.

??Use the debugger for better aspect ratio

If you run the application in your browser, it won't look much like it would on the user's mobile device. As a mobile
developer there are a few commonly used ways to test and debug web apps.

First, you can simply dock the Chrome developer tools to the right, and resize the debugger window to approximate 
the aspect ratio of the running app.

??Use device mode

A way to more accurately emulate the device is to use the Chrome Developer Tools *Device Mode* feature. 
To do that, select the phone icon from the debugger toolbar, and refresh the page. This isn't true emulation &mdash;
Chrome simply sets the aspect ratio for the selected device, and sets request headers to identify the browser as
the specified mobile device.

??Use your own phone!

If you're on a local **wifi** network, you can run the app on your phone. To do that, open your phone's web browser
and enter the development machine's IP address, along with the 1841 port. 

For example, if your development machine 
has the IP address 10.0.1.1, then on your phone you can enter `10.0.1.1:1841/iss` to run the app.
