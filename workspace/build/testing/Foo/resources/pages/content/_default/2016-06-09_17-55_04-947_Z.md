The location URL is what's passed to the browser window. The location URL can
be specified at the project or scenario level.

<div type="expander" caption="Using the Project Location URL">

If you set the Project URL, the scenario URL provides a file path for additional information appended to
the URL. For example, if the Project URL were `http://localhost:1841`, you might set one scenario URL to
`?classic` and another to `?modern`.

<div type="expander" caption="Leaving Project Location URL Blank">

If you leave the Project URL blank, you can put a full URL in the scenario field. This allows
each scenario to visit a unique domain.
