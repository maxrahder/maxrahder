#Introduction

In this lab, you will use Sencha Cmd to generate the starter YelpExtplorer application.

#Steps

??Get the starter code

Download <a href="resources/student/labs/yelpextplorer-classic-starter.zip">YelpExtplorer Starter code</a> and unzip it and place the 
shared and yelpextplorer files into your `SenchaTraining/labs` folder. When you are finished, your `SenchaTraining` folder will 
look like this:

    SenchaTraining
        ext-6
        labs
            debugging
            shared
            yelpextplorer
                resources

                    

??Generate the starter application
 
In the terminal window, navigate to the `SenchaTraining/ext-6` folder. 
 
Generate the YelpExtplorer application by copying and pasting this into the terminal window:
 
+sencha generate app -classic YelpExtplorer ../labs/yelpextplorer+

As a tie-in with Ext JS, the application name is "Yelp**Ext**plorer", so type the name carefully. 
 
??Run the application
 
In your browser, open the newly created application.
 
You should see a tab panel with the tabs on the left. The first tab is a grid,
and the others show *lorem ipsum* text.

??Inspect the application source code
 
In your IDE, look at the `labs/yelpextplorer/` folder. 

You should see several folders and files, as described in lecture. In the following lab steps
you'll look at those, in the order in which they are run.

??Inspect `index.html`
 
Inspect `yelpextplorer/index.html`. It contains two scripts. 

The +Ext.beforeLoad+ function is used with universal applications to determine whether to run
the classic or modern view. The function is commented out for applications that are exclusively
classic or modern.

The other script runs the microloader, which reads `app.json` and loads the required libraries, 
css files and your `app.js`.

??Inspect `app.js`

This file contains the +Ext.application()+, which is the starting point of any Ext JS application.

The application's +mainView+ config creates an instance of the
specified class, and automatically applies the viewport plugin.
 
To keep your logic separate and completely contained within the `app` folder, the code in `app.js` 
 simply subclasses the +Ext.app.Application+ defined in `app/Application.js`. 
 

??Inspect `app/Application.js`
 
This file contains placeholders for global stores and the +launch()+ method, which is 
where you can put code to be run as the application launches. It also contains an +onAppUpdate()+
used to let the user know when the app has been modified.

??Inspect `app/view/main/Main.js`
 
`Main.js` is a tab panel, with four tabs. The first tab holds a grid. The others show *lorem ipsum* text.
The text is defined in the view model, and bound to the panel's +html+ property.
 
??Inspect `app/view/main/List.js`
 
`List.js` is a grid whose store is created in-line using the alias defined in `app/store/Personnel.js`.

The grid's +select+ event is handled by an event handler named *onItemSelected*, defined in
`app/view/main/MainController.js`.
 
??Inspect `app/view/main/MainController.js`
 
Note the +alias+ &mdash; the main view creates the controller via this alias. 
 
The controller contains the method named in the grid's +listeners+ config. 
Furthermore, the message box *onConfirm* callback is naming another controller method. 
This illustrates that event methods are scoped to the controller, whether they are specified 
in the view or the view model, or are added in the controller.

??Inspect `app/view/main/MainModel.js`
 
Note the +alias+ &mdash; the main view creates the view model via this alias.
 
View models can have configs for +data+, +stores+ and +formulas+. This view model
only has a +data+ config, with *name* and *loremIpsum* properties. 

The *name* is used to set the tab panel's header. The *loremIpsum* property provides the HTML used
for three of the tabs.

Change the value of *name* to something else, like "Hi There!", then save your change and refresh your 
browser window. You should see the new value in the tab panel's title. 
 
<img src="resources/images/yelp/HiThere.jpg">
 
Now open the view controller again, and in the +onConfirm()+ method's +if+ statement, add this code:
+this.getViewModel().set('name', 'This Is a New Title');+
 
The code updates the view model's *name* property. Since the west panel's title is bound to that property, when
the property changes, the title will change.
 
Save and refresh your browser. If you click on the button, then respond "Yes", your new code will be run,
and the title should automatically change.


# Conclusion

In this lab, you used Sencha Cmd to generate a new starter application. 
As we write the YelpExtplorer app, we will refactor this starting point and 
add new views and models. We will also modify the view model and view controller.
