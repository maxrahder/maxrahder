The recommended way of including rtl styling is to build your app using a RTL locale. 
You can set the locale in the `sencha.cfg` file:

<pre>app.locale=he</pre>

Then, build your app, it should build with localized **hebrew** text, a stylesheet that includes rtl styling, 
and js overrides that add support for rtl layouts.
