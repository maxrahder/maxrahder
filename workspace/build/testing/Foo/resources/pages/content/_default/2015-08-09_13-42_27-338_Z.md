#Introduction
 
In this lab you'll create a modern starter application and review its structure. A modern
app is structured a Touch 2.x app.

#Steps

??Generate the starter application

In the terminal window, go to the `SenchaTraining/ext-6` folder and type this command:

    sencha generate app -modern MyModern ../labs/mymodern


??Run the application

Now use your Web browser to visit the new application. You'll see the starter app.

??Look at `app/view/main/Main.js`

The main view is a tab panel. Like the classic version, there's a lot of binding. Touch does
not have the bindable mixin, but Modern does.

There's no responsive code because the responsive plugin and mixin are not yet part of modern.

Like the classic app, most of the tabs simply show *lorem ipsum* text. The application also
has a grid, and it also creates a store via an alias. 


??Look at `app/Application.js`

This is structured like the classic app, and uses the +onAppUpdate+ method. 

??Look at `app.js`

This is also structured like the classic app, and uses +mainView+.
