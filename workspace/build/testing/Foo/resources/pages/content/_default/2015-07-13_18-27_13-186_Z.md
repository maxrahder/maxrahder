#Introduction

In this lab, you will set up the starter YelpExtplorer application.


#If you do <u>not</u> already have a running copy of YelpExtplorer

??Create the folders that we'll use for class

If you don't already have it, create the folder `SenchaTraining`, containing an empty `labs` folder and a copy of the 
Ext JS framework.  `SenchaTraining` can be anywhere on your computer, such as the root of `C:` or at your user root folder `~`.
When you are finished, `SenchaTraining` should look like this:

    SenchaTraining
        ext-6
        labs

The `ext-6` folder is your previously downloaded copy of the Ext JS library.

??Start the server
 
If your server is not currently running. Using a terminal window, navigate to `SenchaTraining` and enter

    sencha web start

This starts the server. The terminal window is used for the server, so leave it open and running.


??Get the starter code

Download <a href="resources/student/labs/yelpextplorer-universal-starter.zip">the starter code</a>. 
It contains two folders: `shared` and `yelpextplorer`. Unzip it and place the two folders inside 
 the `SenchaTraining/labs` folder. When you are finished, `SenchaTraining` should look like this:

    SenchaTraining
        ext-6
        labs
            shared
            yelpextplorer


The `labs/shared` folder contains some shared code used by YelpExtplorer.

The `labs/yelpextplorer` folder contains the source code for the classic version of YelpExtplorer.


??Generate the classic starter application

In a new terminal window, navigate to the `SenchaTraining/ext-6` folder.

Generate the YelpExtplorer application by copying and pasting this into the terminal window:

    sencha generate app -classic -starter=false YelpExtplorer ../labs/yelpextplorer

This generates the infrastructure for a classic Ext JS application. The +-starter=false+ parameter means starter code is
not created because you already placed your starter code in the `yelpextplorer` folder.


??Do a development build

The first time an application is created, you need to initialize the microloader and create the CSS. 
To do that, use a terminal window and, in the `labs/yelpextplorer` folder, enter

    sencha app build development


??Run the classic version of YelpExtplorer

Open a browser window and run the app.

#Everyone complete these steps


??Generate the universal starter application

Rename the `labs/yelpextplorer` folder that you've been working on. Name it `yelpextplorer-saved`.

If you have a terminal window for `yelpextplorer` open, close it.
 
Then, in a terminal window, navigate to the `SenchaTraining/ext-6` folder and enter this:
    
    sencha generate app -starter=false YelpExtplorer ../labs/yelpextplorer
    
The *-starter=false* param means the app infrastructure is created, but there will not be
an `app` folder .
    
??Set up the source folders

Create three directories, and two sub-directories:

- `yelpextplorer/app`
- `yelpextplorer/classic/src`
- `yelpextplorer/modern/src`

The `app` folder will hold shared code. The classic folder will hold the existing YelpExtplorer app.
The modern folder will hold the modern app you'll be coding in class.

??Move the classic code

<div style="margin-bottom: 1em"></div>

- Copy the contents of `yelpextplorer-saved/app` to `yelpextplorer/classic/src`. 
- Copy the `yelpextplorer-saved/sass` folder to `yelpextplorer/classic`.
- Copy the `yelpextplorer-saved/resources` folder to `yelpextplorer`.

<div style="margin-bottom: 1em"></div>

- Move `yelpextplorer/classic/src/Application.js` to the `yelpextplorer/app` folder.

<div style="margin-bottom: 1em"></div>

- Edit `yelpextplorer/index.html` and add this tag immediately after the +<title>...</title>+ element:


    <script src="http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=geometry"></script>


??Add an initial modern view

The app needs a main modern view. 

Open a terminal window and navigate to `labs/yelpextplorer` and enter:

    sencha generate view -modern -b 'Ext.Container' main.Main

This will create a main view with a base class (-b) of Ext.Container, a view controller and a view model, all within the modern/src portion of the app.

Edit `yelpextplorer/modern/src/view/main/Main.js` and give it +xtype:'app-main'+.

Edit `yelpextplorer/modern/src/view/main/MainModel.js` and remove the +data+ config.

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel', {
        extend: 'Ext.app.ViewModel',
        alias: 'viewmodel.main-main'
    });

Note that Cmd decided to name the view model and controller aliases *main-main*. But in your classic
app, those have the alias *main*. That's ok, but don't be confused by that inconsistency.


??Update `app.json`

Copy and replace two configs from `yelpextplorer-saved/app.json` to `yelpextplorer/app.json`

- Copy and replace the *"classpath"* config
- Copy and replace the *"requires"* config

??Run the new universal app

After generating the starter app, and moving the source files, etc., you now have a new universal
app that contains the same code as in `yelpextplorer-saved`.

Since you've edited `app.json`, and also copied some Sass files, you need to build the app.

Use a terminal window to navigate to `SenchaTraining/labs/yelpextplorer` and run:

    sencha app build development

Then, run `yelpextplorer` in your browser. It should run just like `yelpextplorer-saved`.

You can also view the modern portion of the app. Within Chrome, to run an application as a modern app, you can either: 

- from the Developer Tools toolbar, turn on device emulation, select a device to emulate, then refresh, or 
- add `?modern` to the URL, before the hash mark.

The code for the modern UI is in `modern/src/view/main/Main.js`. There's not much there
&mdash; it's just a container with its +html+ set to +Hello World!!+.


??Review binding and flow of the classic application

The app is the same as the application coded in the intermediate Ext JS training course. 
However, it has been refactored to be a universal app by moving the classes originally in the
`app` folder to the `classic/src` folder.

Re-run the application as a classic app, and try typing in a city or category. 

Look at `classic/src/view/main/Main.js` and note how the filter is coded. It's docked at the top,
and bound to *typedCity* and *typedCategory*. (If you're running your own code, you might have
the bindings in `classic/view/businesses/Filter.js`.) As the user types, the values are pushed onto 
the view model.

Look at the +initViewModel+ method in `classic/src/view/main/MainController.js`. Note that as 
*typedCity* and *typedCategory* change, the *city* and *category* properties change. And as
*city* and *category* change, the *businesses* store is loaded. 

Look at `classic/src/view/businesses/TabPanel.js`. The map, view, and grid are 
using the *businesses* store. As the store changes, they update automatically.
Those components are also set up to push their selection (which is a business record) to the 
view model *business* property. 

Look at `classic/src/view/main/Main.js` and note how the east panel is coded. As *business*
changes, the east panel's *data* setter is run. 

Look at `classic/src/view/business/Detail.js`. A component's template is updated as its +setData()+
is run. So the flow is: As the user selects a business, the view model *business* changes. As
that changes, the detail panel's +setData()+ method is run, passing in the business record, and
the record's values are used in the template.

??Think about the modern binding

How much of the common controller and view model can the modern UI use? Just about all of it! 
When you code the modern UI, as long as you wire up the text fields to *typedCity* and *typedCategory*, 
and bind the map and list *selection* to *business*, it should all work.
