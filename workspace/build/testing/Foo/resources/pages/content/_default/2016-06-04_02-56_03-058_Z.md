If you need utility routines, you can create a singleton holding the routines.

Singletons are easy to create &mdash; you only need to define a class, and mark 
it as a singleton. Then when the class is loaded, an instance is created and 
referenced by the class name.

<pre class="runnable 260">
// This would be in app/util/Chemistry.js
Ext.define('MyApp.util.Chemistry', {
    singleton: true,
    avogadroConstant: 6.02214129e23
});
Ext.Msg.alert('Avogadro\'s Number', MyApp.util.Chemistry.avogadroConstant);
</pre>
