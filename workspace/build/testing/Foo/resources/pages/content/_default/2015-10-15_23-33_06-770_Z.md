Ideally, +Main+ controls how it interacts with the classes it uses:

<ul>
<li>+Umbrella+ has a public property *rainy*
<li>+Umbrella+ reacts to changes in *rainy* and updates its UI internally
<li>+Umbrella+ isn't referencing anything outside of its class
<li>+Main+ creates an instance of +Umbrella+, and wires *rainy* to a view model 

</ul>
