JavaScript developers are used to using libraries. Typically, you'd create an `index.html`, and create 
a +<script>+ tag to load the library, and perhaps a +<link>+ to get the library's stylesheet. 

Then,
you'd create another +<script>+ tag containing your own code, and you'd start trying things out.

Now we'll code a simple application, starting with `index.html` and, bit by bit, add more Ext JS features.
