Scenarios group a set of tests. The tests within a scenario share common run-time information, 
such as routing information added to the default application URL. Scenarios can also specify that 
additional libraries be loaded.

On the file system, a scenario correponds to a folder *within* the `test` folder. You can name the 
folder anything you want. Common names of a scenario folder might be `unit`, `integration` or `user`.

Furthermore, you can nest the folders to logically group the tests.
