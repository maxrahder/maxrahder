Apple has a couple of relevant data feeds: 

- The <a href="https://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html" target="_blank">Search API</a> lets you use search terms to find items on iTunes, the App Store, iBooks and the Mac App Store. 
- There are also various <a href="http://www.apple.com/rss/" target="_blank">Apple RSS Feeds</a>.
- There is also an excellent RSS Generator <a href="https://rss.itunes.apple.com/" target="_blank">RSS Feed Generator</a>.

For the video preview app you'll use an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topmusicvideos/limit=50/json" target="_blank">Top iTunes Music Videos feed</a>.
