Go to the 
<a href="http://dev.sencha.com/ext/5.0.0/examples/kitchensink/#all" target="_blank">Kitchen Sink app</a>, 
and visit a few pages. Then press the back button a few times. Kitchen Sink remembers where you have visited.
<br><br>
But wait. The Kitchen Sink is a single page app! So why does back work, and how 
does the Kitchen Sink know what sections to go to?

<div type="expander" caption="Here's How">
<ul>
 <li>Routes allow you to detect and update the URI to tag the user's location on the page</li>
 <li>The information is placed in the URI *fragment identifier*, which is any information after a hash mark at the end of a URI</li>
 <li>The change in the URI is detected by the browser, which adds the URI to its history</li>
 <li>As the URI changes, either via back/next, or a bookmarked page, your code is passed the route information, 
 and updates the user interface accordingly</li>
 <li>Try the <a href="http://dev.sencha.com/ext/5.0.0/examples/kitchensink/#all" target="_blank">Kitchen Sink app</a>, 
again, and notice the URI as you go from page to page</li>
 </ul>
