<pre class="runnable 200">
Ext.create('Ext.Component', {
    html: 'Hello world!',
    style : {border: 'thin solid red'},
    width: 300,
    height: 100,
    renderTo: Ext.getBody()
});</pre>

The +height+ and +width+
configs are not used as often as you might think, because components either have a natural size or 
their size is determined by their parent's layout manager.
