An +Ext.navigation.View+ is a card-layout container implemented as a stack &mdash;
the top card is shown to the user. 

Under program control, running +push()+ on the navigation view pushes a new card
onto the container. The new card becomes the top card and, therefore, is shown to the user.

Navigation views are a very handy way of doing view drill-down.
