#Introduction
 
In this lab, you'll create a universal starter application and review its structure.



#Steps

??Generate the starter application

In the terminal window, go to the `SenchaTraining/ext-6` folder and type this statement:

    sencha generate app MyUniversal ../labs/myuniversal


??Run the application

Now use your Web browser to visit the new application. You'll see the starter app.

By default, the application runs as a classic app. If you turn on mobile phone emulation in the Chrome 
Developer Tools toolbar, select a device to emulate, and then refresh the browser, it runs as a modern app.

Alternatively, you can add `?classic` or `?modern` to the end of the URL, to explicitly run the 
classic or modern version.

??Look at the folder structure

A universal app has three key folders:

- `app`
- `classic/src`
- `modern/src`

The `app` folder holds shared code, such as models or view controllers.

The `classic` and `modern` directories are structured like code packages, with `src` and
`sass` folders. Their `src` folders are structured like in any application.

Each toolkit can reference the classes within its own toolkit folder, and classes within the shared 
app folder. A toolkit, however, can *not* reference classes from the other toolkit.


??Look at the main views

Look at `modern/src/view/main/Main.js` and `classic/src/view/main/Main.js`.

The main views are just just like they were in the individual modern and classic starter 
apps that you created. But there's one huge difference &mdash; there are no view models or controllers
in the `main` folders. Each main view class still requires and creates its view model and
controller, but in the universal starter app they use a *shared* controller and view 
model!

??Look at `app/view/main`

The shared view model and controller classes are in the `app` folder. 

In a universal application, classes in the `modern` folder may reference other classes within 
`modern`,  or shared classes in the `app` folder.
Similarly, classes within the `classic` folder may reference other classes within `classic`, 
or shared classes in `app` folder. 

This lets you share controllers, view models, record definitions, and other classes between 
`modern` and `classic`. Component classes do not go in the `app` folder &mdash; the toolkit folders
`classic` and `modern` hold component classes. 

??Look at `app/Application.js`

This is structured like it is in the classic app and modern starter apps. In a universal app, this one 
copy of `Application.js` is shared by both the `classic` and `modern` views.

??Look at `app.js`

This is also structured like it is in the classic and modern starter apps. 

In a universal app, the +mainView+ class *must* exist in both the `classic` and `modern` folders.
