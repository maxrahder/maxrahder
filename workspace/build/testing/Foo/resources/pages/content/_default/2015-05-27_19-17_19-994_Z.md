*Fashion* is the name of Sencha's pure JavaScript Compass implementation. 
Like Compass, Fashion compiles SCSS into CSS. There are several benefits:

<div type="expander" caption="No Ruby Dependency">
The Sencha build proccess runs Compass to generate the CSS needed at runtime. 
And Compass requires Ruby. So in previous versions of Ext JS, you needed Ruby 
to do a build.

<div type="expander" caption="It's Quicker">
The Compass phase of builds was slow. Fasionion is much quicker, which means 
builds are quicker and <kbd>sencha app watch</kbd> is more responsive. 
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Fashion Can Run in the Browser">
Eventually, Sencha will provide tooling to edit SCSS for a running application.
This will means you can edit SCSS variables and immediately see the effect.
