#Dynamic Loading No Longer Occurs

The +requires:[]+ works by saying "If the specified class is not in memory, get it." When you do a build, Sencha Cmd 
creates a single large JavaScript file with all class definitions occuring before the class is used. 

This means dynamic loading is no longer needed.

It also allows the build to remove string references of classes. For example, 
+extend:'Ext.panel.Panel'+ becomes +extend:Ext.panel.Panel+
