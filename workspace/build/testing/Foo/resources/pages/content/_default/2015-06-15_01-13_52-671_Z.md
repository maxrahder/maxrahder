Some code examples in our course work, even though they omit a +requires+ 
entry for a classs they use. What's up with that?

The iframe used for the examples uses a copy of the library that has 
*all* components. So all library components have already been loaded 
by the time any example is run, and therefore, the examples don't
need to require them. That's bad style, but we may see that now and then.

As a developer, you may have classes that work even though they appear
to be missing needed +requires+. 
That usually happens in cases where some other class you use is already 
requiring the class in question. That's especially true of key base classes,
such as +Ext.panel.Panel+ and +Ext.button.Button+
