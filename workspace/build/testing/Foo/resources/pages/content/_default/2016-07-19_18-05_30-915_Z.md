At its most basic, an app can be thought of as a black box, and tested in terms of its inputs and outputs.
The inputs are user interactions and Ajax responses. You've written
tests against both.

<ul style="list-style-position: inside;">
<li>You used recordings and futures to test user input
<li>You used simlets to test Ajax responses.
</ul>

But how about testing what's sent to the backend?
