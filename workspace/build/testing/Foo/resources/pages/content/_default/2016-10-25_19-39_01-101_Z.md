#Introduction

In this lab you'll add the Earthquakes application to the workspace. The application
shows recent tremors in Iceland.

#Steps 

??Get the app source code

Download the <a href="resources/student/labs/senchatest/Earthquakes.zip">Earthquakes starter code</a> 
and unzip it into your `SenchaTest/workspace` folder. When you are finished, the folder will look like this:


    ext-6
    workspace
        .sencha
        build
        Earthquakes
            app
            app.js
            classic
            index.html
            modern
        ext
        HitchhikersGuide
        packages
        workspace.json


??Generate the app infrastructure using Sencha Cmd

Using a terminal window, navigate to `SenchaTest/workspace/ext` and then copy-and-paste and run this command:

    sencha generate app -starter=false Earthquakes ../Earthquakes


??Initialize the microloader and stylesheet

Using a terminal window, navigate to `SenchaTraining/workspace/Earthquakes/` and copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha app build development

This command processes `app.json`, creates a fresh copy of the microloader bootstrap files, and 
creates the stylesheet.


??Run the app
 
 Run the app at <a href="http://localhost:1841/Earthquakes/" target="lab">http://localhost:1841/Earthquakes/</a>
 
 A map showing the locations of recent earthquakes in Iceland is displayed at the top. A grid of data, linked to 
 the map, is displayed below. Clicking on an item shows a message with the time and location of the tremor.
