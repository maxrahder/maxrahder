Desktop user-interface programming revolves around three concepts:

<div type="expander" caption="Components" class="x-hidden">
Components are visual widgets. They have height and width, etc.
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Containers (and layouts)" class="x-hidden">
Containers contain components and arrange them according to the rules of the container's layout.
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Events" class="x-hidden">
Events give you the ability to detect and react to user actions, like clicking on a button.
</div>
