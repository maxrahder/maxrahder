Selenium WebDriver can also be set up via Node.js, as you'll do in the next lab. You'll install the 
package via:
    
    npm install selenium-webdriver -g
    npm install selenium-standalone@latest -g
    selenium-standalone install    

Then, to run the server, you'll enter

    selenium-standalone start
    

For more syntax options, see <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-standalone" target="_blank">the Selenium Standalone npm documentation</a>.
