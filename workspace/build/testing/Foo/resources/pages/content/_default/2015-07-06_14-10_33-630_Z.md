Selection models fire a +select+ and +selectionchange+ events 
(and some others). As a convenience, these events are also fired 
by the grid, so normally you listen to the grid event rather 
than listen to the selection model directly.

The +select+ event handler has the signature 
<br/>+select(selectionModel, record)+
<br/>This event lets you know what just got selected.

The +selectionchange+ event handler has the signature 
<br/>+selectionchange(selectionModel, record[])+
<br/>This event lets you know everything currently selected.
