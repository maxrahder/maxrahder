Sencha Ext JS provides the industryâ€™s most comprehensive collection of high-performance, customizable UI widgets. 
including HTML5 grids, trees, lists, forms, menus, toolbars, panels, windows, and much more. There are also 
hundreds of user extensions developed by the Sencha community.

Ext JS is class-based, which means components are inherently reusable and extensible.
