You can mark a spec as pending via +xit+. Pending specs are not run
but show up in the results marked "pending".

<pre class="runnable readonly 200">
describe("Shared Geocode", function() {

    xit("returns the correct latitude and longitude for an address", function(done) {
        // I'm not sure how to test this yet.
    });

    it("returns the user\'s current position"); // This is also a pending spec.

});
</pre>
