#Introduction

In this lab, you will code a popup window that's used to edit the selected business record.

#Steps

??Review the requirements

We need to enhance the detail panel by adding an Edit button in a +tbar+ and a link to Yelp in a +bbar+.

Clicking the edit button opens a window containing a form panel used to edit business information. The form
should be initialized with data from the selected business and, upon saving, should update the business record.

Note the key aspects of the window: 
- It contains a single child &mdash; a form panel
- The form panel has two components &mdash; a text field and a slider
- The form panel has a Save and a Cancel button

??Add the Edit toolbar to the detail panel

Edit `view/business/Detail.js`.

Add a +tbar+ with a button with +text:'Edit'+. 

Then bind to the business, so it's enabled or disabled, depending on whether there is 
a selected business:

    bind: {
        disabled: '{!business}'
    }

Add a +bbar+ with a single item, configured like this:

    {
        xtype: 'component',
        height: 25,
        width: 155,
        html: [
            '<a href="http://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">',
            '<img src="resources/images/Powered_By_Yelp_Red.png"/></a>'
        ]
    }

Save and refresh, and verify that you can see the two toolbars, and verify that the 
Edit button is initially disabled, and becomes enabled when you select a business.


??Use Sencha Cmd to generate the edit business window class

Use Sencha Cmd to generate the view +business.edit.Window+. Sencha Cmd will create the 
specified view and its associated view model and view controller. 

To do this, use a terminal window, and from within the `yelpextplorer` project folder type:

    sencha generate view business.edit.Window



??Make the class a window

Edit `app/view/business/edit/Window.js`. Have it extend +Ext.window.Window+ and 
give it +xtype:'editbusinesswindow'+. Remove the +html+ property.

When you are finished it should look like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly 280">
Ext.define("YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.Window", {
    extend: "Ext.window.Window",
	xtype: "editbusinesswindow",
    requires: [
        'YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.WindowController',
	    'YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.WindowModel'
    ],
	controller: "business-edit-window",
    viewModel: {
        type: 'business-edit-window'
	}
});
</pre>


??Show the edit window when the user selects Edit

Edit `view/business/Detail.js` and put a handler on the edit button. Have 
it run +onEditClick+ in the business detail controller.

Edit `view/business/DetailController.js` and implement the event handler. For now
just show the window with a hard-coded title and a set height and width:

    onEditClick: function(button) {
        this.getView().add(Ext.create({
            xtype: 'editbusinesswindow',
            title: 'Business',
            height: 200,
            width: 200,
            autoShow: true
        }));
    }

As usual, since the code is creating an object, you need to require the class.
In this case, that means adding +requires: ["YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.Window"]+ to the detail controller.

Note that the code adds the window as a child of the detail view. The benefit of making it a child
is that the window will then have access to view model properties up the hierarchy. 

If you save and refresh, then select a business and click the edit button, you should see the
edit window.

??Start coding the form
 
Edit `app/view/business/edit/Window.js` and use this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define("YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.Window", {
	extend: 'Ext.window.Window',
	xtype: 'editbusinesswindow',
	requires: ['YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.WindowController','YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.WindowModel','Ext.form.Panel'],
	controller: 'business-edit-window',
	viewModel: {
		type: 'business-edit-window'
	},
	resizable: false,
	bodyPadding: 8,
	modal: true,

	layout: 'fit',
	
	items: [{
		xtype: 'form',
		reference: 'form',
		items: [
		    // Text field goes here
		],
		buttons: [{
			text: 'Save'
		}, {
			text: 'Cancel'
		}]
	}]

});
</pre>

Inspect the code. The window has a single item &mdash; a form. It uses layout *fit*, since 
there's only one item, and we want it to take up all the available space. It's modal, and
not resizable. It has padding, so the form fields don't touch the edges of the window. 
It also has Save and Cancel buttons. 


??Add a text field to the form

Add a text field to the form with +xtype:'textfield'+  and +fieldLabel:'Name'+. Bind its *value*
property to *{business.name}*.

Recall that +name+ is a key property of input fields. We would specify +name+ if
we were doing a form submit because the name-value pair is submitted to the back end.
But in this case we'll be binding to the business record, so the record will hold the 
data. Therefore, we don't need to specify a +name+ for the field.

Now that there's content in the window, it will size itself natually based on its content. That
means you no longer need the +height+ and +width+ configs used when you create the window. Edit
`app/view/business/DetailController.js` and remove those configs:

    onEditClick: function(button) {
        this.getView().add(Ext.create({
            xtype: 'editbusinesswindow',
            title: 'Business',
            autoShow: true
        }));
    }

Save and refresh. Choose a business, click edit and you should see the window and text field. The text
field should show the name of the selected record. Note that, as you edit the name, the panel in the background 
(whether map, view, or grid) automatically reflects the change! That's because the text field is bound to 
the record's *name* property, so everything bound to it reflects the change. Also note that the only
way to dismiss the window is to click on the +X+ in the window's title bar &mdash; you'll implement 
the code for the Save and Cancel buttons in the following lab steps.

??Detect when the user presses Save and Cancel

Add a handler to the Save button, and have it run *onSaveClick*. Add a handler to the Cancel
button, and have it run *onCancelClick*. 

Edit `app/view/business/edit/WindowController.js` and implement the *onSave* and *onCancel* 
methods. Initially, have each just log a console message so you know they are being run. 
<pre>
onSaveClick: function(button){
	console.log('onSave');
},
onCancelClick: function(button){
	console.log('onCancel');
}
</pre>

Save and refresh. Look for the console logs when you click Save and Cancel.


??Have the Cancel button reject changes to the record

Records keep track of their original values. So even though you're editing the record as
you change the name, you can reject the change when the user presses Cancel. 

Modify the code to have +onCancelClick+ get a reference to the business record from the view model and 
run its +reject()+ method. Then close the the window. How do you programatically close a window? First you 
need a reference to the window, which you can get via +this.getView()+, then you need to run a 
method to close it. You could guess the name of the method for closing a window, or you can look 
it up in the API docs. 

When you are finished editing +onCancelClick+, the method will have
two statements &mdash; the first statement rejects changes to the record, and the second statement closes the window.

Save your changes, then select the grid tab and select a business. Then open the edit
window and change the name of a business. If you press Cancel, the record should revert to its original value.


??Have the Save button commit changes to the record

Edit the +onSaveClick+ method and have it commit the changes to the record. You need to do that because 
the +reject()+ method reverts to the *previously committed values*. To commit changes, get a reference 
to the business record from the view model and form, and run its +commit()+ method. Then close the window. 

When you are finished editing +onSave+, the method will have two statements &mdash; the first statement 
commits changes to the record, and the second statement closes the window.

Save your changes, then test things out by editing a record and pressing Save, re-editing the record, 
making changes and pressing Cancel, and so forth.


??Add record validation
 
There are two ways to validate data: either on the form field, or in the record. We'll do the latter.
 
Edit `app/model/Business.js` and add a field config for *name* &mdash; this makes the name field required:
    
    fields: [{
        name: 'name',
        validators: [{
            type: 'presence'
        }]
    }, {
        name: 'latitude',
        mapping: 'location.coordinate.latitude'
    }, {
        name: 'longitude',
        mapping: 'location.coordinate.longitude'
    }]

??Wire up the form to use record validation 

Edit `app/view/business/edit/Window.js` and add +modelValidation:true+ to the form's config. This
config looks at any field bound to a value, and validates on the associated record's validators.
Be careful to add this to the form's config, and not to the config for the window or field.

In addition, add +formBind:true+ to the Save button's config. This will enable or disable the button
based on whether the form is valid. 

Save, refresh, and test your changes by editing a business and emptying the name. You should see 
a red border around the field, indicating that it's invalid, and the Save button should become disabled.
If you hover over the field you should see the default error message for the validator.

#Optional challenge

??Use the rating widget
 
Add a second item to the form: a rating widget. (You'll be doing this on your own.)

The code will be similar to the widget config used in the grid, but in addition, you'll need to bind 
its +value+ property to the *{business.rating}*.

When you're finished, save and refresh your browser window. If you edit a business you should see both 
the name and star rating being updated.
