#Introduction

In this lab, you'll explore the “Layout Runs” tab which enables you to watch *how* a 
Sencha application recalculates the sizes and positions for components as the user interacts with it in real-time.

?? Watching the layout changes

In order to see a layout run, you need to start watching the layout. 
Click “Watch” and then switch into your browser. Begin interacting with the application. 
When you return to Sencha Inspector, you should see that several layout runs have been logged.

In Ext JS, the page and component layouts are managed by the framework using JavaScript. Any time a component 
is added, removed, or resized, the framework needs to recalculate layouts. 
The obvious implication is that performance problems might occur if the framework needs to spend long CPU 
cycles recalculating the sizes and positions of components.

Opening up a layout run, you can see exactly what components are affected.

You can stop watching the layout by clicking the same button. 

?? Clearing the layout

Similarly, use the “Clear” button to clear the layout run log.

The components in layout runs are listed in the order they occur as the layout manager recalculates them.

?? Revealing a component

If you select a component, you can click “Reveal” to find the same component in the “Components” tab for closer inspection.

# Conclusion

Sencha Inspector makes it much easier to drill down into layouts to search for performance bottlenecks.
