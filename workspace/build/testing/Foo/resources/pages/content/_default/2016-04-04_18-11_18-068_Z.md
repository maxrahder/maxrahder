##Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do tests go?<br>A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A workspace can hold tests, and an application can hold tests.

Therefore, if you have a workspace holding several applications, there are two places where tests may be held: 
- At the workspace level, and also 
- Within each app

If you are testing a single app, and the app itself is the workspace, then the
tests only go within the app.
