#You Won't Use "new" Very Often

The bottom line is, with Ext JS, you rarely use the +new+ operator. 

Exceptions are:

- You may need to create a Date object via a statement like +new Date();+
- You may use construction functions in other libraries, such as +new google.maps.LatLng(33.67, -95.53);+
