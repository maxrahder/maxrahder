The Astronauts tab will show a list of astronauts in space.

You already know how to do most of what's needed:

- Define an +Ext.data.Model+ that configures the proxy 
- Create an *astronauts* store in the main view model
- Create an +Ext.dataview.List+, bound to the store

You'll also show each astronaut's portrait in the list. But
the feed doesn't include an image URL. For that feature, 
you'll code your own utility class that fetches an image 
from Wikimedia. 

Finally, to explore more features of Ext JS, you'll also
do some Sass styling. Sass is an open source CSS extension
language. You'll code a style using Sass, then build it
into the project's CSS, and use the style in the list.
