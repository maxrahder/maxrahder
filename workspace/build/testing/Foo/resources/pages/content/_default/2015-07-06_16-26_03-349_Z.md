+Ext.mixin.Mashup+ lets you include external scipts in your application without 
having to specify the scripts in `app.json` or in `index.html`.

This class is a mixin. It requires that you provide a +requiredScripts:[]+, 
listing the external script URLs. 

Application launch is delayed until all the scripts are loaded.
