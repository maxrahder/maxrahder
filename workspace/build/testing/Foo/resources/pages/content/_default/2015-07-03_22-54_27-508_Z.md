Grids are panels, so you can specify a title, toolbars, buttons, tools and generally
treat it like any other panel.

In addition, the grid ancestor &mdash; +Ext.panel.Table+ &mdash; introduces the 
properties: +store+, which contains the data being shown, and +columns:[]+, which describes 
each column in the grid.
