In this section, we'll take a classic Ext JS grid and turn it into a Pivot Grid.

Below is an entry from our salespersons dataset:

<pre>
{
 "orderid": 65338,
 "salesperson": 
 "John Doe",
 "orderdate": 
 "19/04/2012",
 "amount": 930,
 "country": "United States"
}
</pre>

Multiple salespersons exist within the dataset. We want to enable the user to pivot data into the following views by salesperson:

* Total sales
* Yearly sales
* Sales by Country

First, we'll take a look at the data in a generic grid in the next slide.
