#Introduction

In this lab, you'll look at events being fired in real time.

?? Watching for Events

In order to start tracking events, click “Watch”. 

While Inspector is watching the events, **all** events that occur inside the app will appear in the log below in the order in 
which they occur. Click the button again to stop watching.

?? Clearing Events

Click “Clear” to clear the log.

The event will display its name, source, xtype of the source, and component ID of the source.

?? Filtering Events

It is possible to filter out mouse events (in any interaction, browsers generate a lot of mouse events) by entering your own 
filter in the filter bar. 

NOTE: The filter is dynamic.  Adding or Removing the filter will alter the events displayed in the window.

# Conclusion

Sencha Inspector makes it much easier to see available events being generated. This can be an excellent way to determine the best 
way, and time to interact with the application.
