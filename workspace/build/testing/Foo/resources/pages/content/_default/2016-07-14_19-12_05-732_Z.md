#Introduction

In this lab you'll use Sencha Studio's *code coverage* feature
to see what parts of your application aren't being tested. Then you'll 
improve the tests to run more of the application. 

#Steps

??Re-run the HitchhikersGuide application test

Re-run the `HitchhikersGuide > Tests > application` test scenario. All the specs should pass. 


??Run code coverage

Now click the `Coverage` run button. This will run your test and track code coverage. The process will 
take longer than running without code coverage.

??Look at the report

After the tests run, Studio takes you to a report showing the various classes and packages used by your app.

Note that *all* classes used by the app are included, including classes in the Ext library itself!


??Add code coverage filters

By default, code coverage tracks *all* the app logic being run, including code in the Ext JS
library. You don't want that, so go to the *Project Settings* page and add two *Code Coverage Filters*: 

    ^/ext/.*?$
    .*/bootstrap.js 

The filters are regex expressions. The first filter omits any file starting with `/ext/`, which means anything from
the library. The second filter omits any `bootstrap.js` file.

??Run code coverage

Now re-run the *application* test scenario using code coverage.

??Look at the report

Click on package and class names to drill down until you get to the code level.
At the top of the report the breadcrumb trail is also clickable, letting you pop up.
Spend a few minutes exploring the report.

??Add a feature

Wait! You forgot to add the UI for encrypting the quote! In the next several steps, you'll add that code, 
see that code coverage for the new code is poor, and then add tests to achieve better coverage.

To add the feature, edit `HitchhikersGuide/app/view/quote/QuoteView.js` and add a separator and button group to the +tbar+. 
Simply replace the +tbar+ with this config. The align and title buttons are the same as before, but now there's an additional
button group, which pushes the button value *original*, *nsa* or *gch* onto the view model variable *encryption*. 

<pre class="runnable readonly text">
tbar: [{
        xtype: 'choosealign',
        bind: {
            value: '{align}'
        }
    },
    '-', {
        xtype: 'titlechoiceview',
        bind: {
            value: '{title}'
        }
    }, '-', {
        xtype: 'segmentedbutton',
        value: 'original',
        bind: {
            value: '{encryption}'
        },
        items: [{
            text: 'Original',
            value: 'original'
        }, {
            text: 'NSA',
            value: 'nsa'
        }, {
            text: 'GCH',
            value: 'gch'
        }]
    }
]
</pre>

Run the application in a browser window and you'll see the new button group. But these encryption buttons have no effect yet.

??Modify the view model


Edit `HitchhikersGuide/app/view/quote/QuoteViewModel.js` and completely replace it with this code. 

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.QuoteViewModel', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.ViewModel',
    alias: 'viewmodel.quoteviewmodel',
    requires: ['HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt'],

    quotes: {
        'Towels': 'The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say on the subject of towels.<br><br>A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitch hiker can have. Partly it has great practical value — you can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble‐sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a mini raft down the slow heavy river Moth; wet it for use in hand‐to‐hand‐combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or to avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mindbogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can\'t see it, it can\'t see you — daft as a bush, but very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.<br><br>More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value. For some reason, if a strag (strag: nonhitchhiker) discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, washcloth, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet-weather gear, space suit etc., etc. Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitchhiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitchhiker might have accidentally "lost.". What the strag will think is that any man that can hitch the length and breadth of the Galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through and still know where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.<br><br>Hence a phrase that has passed into hitchhiking slang, as in "Hey, you sass that hoopy Ford Prefect? There\'s a frood who really knows where his towel is." (Sass: know, be aware of, meet, have sex with; hoopy: really together guy; frood: really amazingly together guy.',
        'Babel Fish': '"The Babel fish," said The Hitchhiker\'s Guide to the Galaxy quietly, \"is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy received not from its own carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish.<br><br>\"Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindbogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen to see it as the final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.<br><br>\"The argument goes something like this: \'I refuse to prove that I exist,\' says God, \'for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing.\'<br><br>\"\'But,\' says Man, \' the Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn\'t it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don\'t. QED.<br><br>\"\'Oh dear,\' says God, \'I hadn\'t thought of that,\' and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.<br><br>\"\'Oh, that was easy,\' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing.<br><br>"Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo\'s kidneys, but that didn\'t stop Oolon Colluphid making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his bestselling book, Well That about Wraps It Up for God.<br><br>"Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation."',
        'Freedom': 'The renewed shock had nearly made him spill his drink. He drained it quickly before anything serious happened to it. He then had another quick one to follow the first one down and check that it was all right.<br><br>"Freedom," he said aloud.<br><br>Trillian came on to the bridge at that point and said several enthusiastic things on the subject of freedom.<br><br>"I can\'t cope with it,\" Zaphod said darkly, and sent a third drink down to see why the second hadn\'t yet reported on the condition of the first. He looked uncertainly at both of her and preferred the one on the right.<br><br>He poured a drink down his other throat with the plan that it would head the previous one off at the pass, join forces with it, and together they would get the second to pull itself together. Then all three would go off in search of the first, give it a good talking to and maybe a bit of a sing as well.<br><br>He felt uncertain as to whether the fourth drink had understood all that, so he sent down a fifth to explain the plan more fully and a sixth for moral support.<br><br>[The Guide] had some advice to offer on drunkenness.<br><br>\"Go to it,\" it said, \"and good luck.\"<br><br>It was cross-referenced to the entry concerning the size of the Universe and the ways of coping with that.<br><br>There is an art, it says, or rather, a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. … Clearly, it is this second part, the missing, which presents the difficulties.<br><br>Do not listen to what anybody says to you at this point because they are unlikely to say anything helpful.<br><br>[Zaphod] sat up sharply and started to pull clothes on. He decided that there must be someone in the Universe feeling more wretched, miserable and forsaken than himself, and he determined to set out and find him.<br><br>Halfway to the bridge it occurred to him that it might be Marvin, and he returned to bed.'
    },

    data: {
        title: 'Choose a title',
        encryption: 'original',
        align: 'left'
    },
    formulas: {
        text: {
            bind: {
                title: '{title}',
                encryption: '{encryption}'
            },
            get: function(values) {
                var title = values.title;
                var encryption = values.encryption;
                var q = this.quotes[title] || 'Choose a title';
                if (encryption === 'gch') {
                    q = HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.toGCH(q);
                } else if (encryption === 'nsa') {
                    q = HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt.toNSA(q);
                }
                return q;
            }
        }
    }

});
</pre>

The code has a +requires:['HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt']+, and it also implements the *encryption* variable as a 
formula, bound to *{title}* and *{encryption}*. 

Try it out by running the app in a browser. Choose a title and the various encryption options. Everything should work.


??Run code coverage again

In Sencha Studio, re-run the *application* test scenario using the code coverage option. You'll see
that the +Encrypt.js+ class, in the `util` folder, has very poor coverage.

<img src="resources/images/senchatest/EncryptionPoorCoverage.png">


??Add a test

In Studio, create a Jasmine test suite named `view/Encryption.js` within the *application* scenario.  Replace the content with this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
describe("Encryption.js", function() {
    beforeAll(function() {
        ST.button('titlechoiceview').
        expand().
        and(function(titlechoiceview) {
            ST.button('titlechoiceview menuitem[text="Towels"]').
            click().
            and(function(menuitem, done) {
                done();
            });
        });
    });
    it("should update the view using NSA algorithm", function() {
        ST.button('segmentedbutton button[text="NSA"]').
        click().
        and(function(button) {
            ST.component('quoteview').
            contentLike('Uidegay to the Alaxygay'). // Guide to the Galaxy
            and(function(component, done) {
                done();
            });
        });
    });
});
</pre>

Run the test suite, and all the specs should pass. 

??Re-run code coverage

Now re-run code coverage for the *application* scenario. You should have better coverage for +HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt+

<img src="resources/images/senchatest/EncryptionCodeCoverageNSA.jpg">


??Add another test

Now, in `test/application/view/Encryption.js`, add a test spec for the GCH algorithm:

<pre class="runnable 300">
it("should update the view using GCH algorithm", function() {
    ST.button('segmentedbutton button[text="GCH"]').
    click().
    and(function(button) {
        ST.component('quoteview').
        contentLike('Gubuubidube tubo thube Gubalubaxy'). // Guide to the Galaxy
        and(function(component, done) {
            done();
        });
    });
});</pre>

Re-run the application scenario with code coverage, and you should now have complete coverage for +HitchhikersGuide.util.Encrypt+!
