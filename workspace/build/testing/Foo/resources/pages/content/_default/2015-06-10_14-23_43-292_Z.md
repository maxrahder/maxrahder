+Ext.application()+ is the starting point of an application.

With the debugger console and Live Preview, your code is run after the library and page are fully loaded.
But if the page has not loaded, your Ext JS code won't work correctly.

All dynamic HTML libraries need a way of waiting for the browser to load the page, 
before rendering dynamic HTML. That's where +Ext.application+ comes in.
