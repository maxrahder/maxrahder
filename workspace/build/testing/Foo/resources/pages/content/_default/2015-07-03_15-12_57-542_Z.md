#Introduction

In this lab you'll use a template to show business details in the east panel.


#Steps

??Plan what you'll be doing

Currently, the detail panel doesn't show anything. In this lab you'll use the panel's +tpl+ property to show information from a Business record.

??Bind the business to the map

The map is bound to the location formula and businesses store. 

The map can also be bound to the individual business selected in the map. Businesses are 
selected by clicking on a map marker.  To enable this, edit `classic/src/view/businesses/TabPanel.js`
and bind the map's selection to *{business}*:

    {
        title: 'Map',
        xtype: 'businessesmap',
        bind: {
            location: '{location}',
            store: '{businesses}',
            selection: '{business}'
        }
    }


??Bind the east panel to the business
 
Edit `classic/src/view/main/Main.js` and change the east panel's config so its +data+ property is 
bound to the business model. This will cause +setData()+ to be run, passing the business
record, as the record changes in the view model.
 
    {
        region: 'east',
        xtype: 'businessdetail',
        bind: {
            data: '{business}'
        },
        width: 130
    }
 
Running +setData()+ updates a component's template, but since there is no template yet, the binding has 
no effect on the user interface.

??Create a basic template

Edit `classic/src/view/business/Detail.js`to remove the +html+ property and add this simple template:

    tpl:'<h2>{name}</h2>'

So the information doesn't bump up against the edge of the panel, specify +bodyPadding:6+

If you save and refresh, then select a business on the map, you should see the
detail panel update with the name of the business.

??Enhance the template

Use this template &mdash; it shows a lot more information about the Yelp review.

    tpl: [
        '<tpl if="this.isData(values)">',
        '<div>',
        '<p><b>{name}</b></p>',
        '{[Ext.Array.map(values.categories, function(item){return item[0];}).join("<br/>")]}<br/><br/>',
        '<img src="resources/images/stars_{rating}.png"/><br/>',
        '<img src="{image_url}"/><br/><br/>',
        'Reviews: {review_count}<br/><br/>',
        '{[values.location.display_address.join("<br/>")]}<br/><br/>',
        '<a href="{url}" target="_blank">Full review at Yelp.com</a>',
        '</div>',
        '</tpl>', {
            isData: function (data) {
                return !Ext.Object.isEmpty(data);
            }
        }
    ]

Note the template member function. The +if+ statement at the start of the template is
checking whether the passed data actually contains values. 
 
Try out your new code by saving, refreshing and selecting a business. You should see
business details in the east panel. `:-)`

(The template has some pretty 
ugly code in it! In particular, the code extracting the categories would be hard to 
understand and maintain &mdash; moving some of that code into a member function might 
be a good idea, although we won't bother in this lab.)

# Conclusion

You have bound a template to the view model's business. The template contains a member function.
