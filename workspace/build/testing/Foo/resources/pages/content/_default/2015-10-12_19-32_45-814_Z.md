Challenges with code completion in a prototype based language

-   Strongly typed languages have had an advantage when it comes to code completion and integration with an IDE.

-   Fewer frameworks to deal with and stronger rules were a major reason.

**Solution**

Ext JS, with it's more structured, "class-based" approach to javascript and a complete framework (one that is likely the only 
js framework you will need) make it possible to create a powerful development tool with the benefits difficult to achieve with javascript. 

Currently, the plugin is available for JetBrains editors with Visual Studio and Eclipse plugins just released for early access.
