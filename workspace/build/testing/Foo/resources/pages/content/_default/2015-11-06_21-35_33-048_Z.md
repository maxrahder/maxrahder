As a reminder of the hoisting behavior of variables, some style guides recommend literally coding
all vars at the top of a function. 

<pre class="runnable 230">
// Before
function foo(){
    var b = 0;
    for (var i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i++){
        b += i;
    }
    var a = 'foo';
    var s = 'bar ' + b;
}</pre>

This make the scope of the variables clear to the naive programmer
who may be maintaining the code. It also makes the code minimize to a slightly smaller size, because
the reserved work +var+ cannot be minimized.<sup>\*</sup> On the down-side, moving the var declaration to the top
is a manual chore for the programmer, and there is no runtime performance benefit.

<pre class="runnable 280">
// After
function foo(){
    var b = 0,
        i,
        a = 'foo',
        s;

    for (i = 0 ; i < 4 ; i++){
        b += i;
    }
    s = 'bar ' + b;
}</pre>

<small><sup>\*</sup> Some build tools will automatically hoist the variable declarations in order to get the minimization benefit.</small>
