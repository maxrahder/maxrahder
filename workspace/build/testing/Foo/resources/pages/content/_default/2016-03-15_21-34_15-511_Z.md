Now that you have the ability to show the ISS at a specified location, you need
to add logic to use the Open Notify feed to determine its actual location. You'll
fetch the data via JSONP. 

Once that works, you'll add logic to update the location every few seconds.

The other feature that we need is a *view model*. You'll update a view model property
with the location, then bind that to the map.
