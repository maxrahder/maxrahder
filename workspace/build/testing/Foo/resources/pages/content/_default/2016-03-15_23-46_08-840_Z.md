#Introduction

In this lab you'll record a grid row select, and log the record data. 

This is in preparation for learning a technique for providing hard-coded
data &mdash; you'll learn that in the next lab.

#Steps

??Get the starter code

Download the <a href="resources/student/labs/senchatest/Earthquakes.zip">Earthquakes starter code</a> 
and unzip it into your `SenchaTest/workspace` folder. When you are finished, the folder will look like this:


    ext-6
    workspace
        build
        ext
        Earthquakes
            app
        HitchHikersGuide
        packages
        test


??Generate the app

Using a terminal window, navigate to `SenchaTest/workspace/ext` then copy-and-paste and run this command:

    sencha generate app -classic -starter=false Earthquakes ../Earthquakes

- The +-classic+ parameter tells Cmd to create a classic app 
- The +-starter=false+ parameter means that the normal starter app will be omitted
- *Earthquakes* is the name of the app &mdash; it's the namespace and prefix for all classes
- `../Earthquakes` is the relative path to the folder where the app is generated.

The `Earthquakes` folder already exists, which means the existing code will be preserved.


??Initialize the microloader

Since we omitted creating the normal starter app, you need to initialize the microloader
and generate the initial stylesheet. If we had started with the normal starter app, this
wouldn't be needed. (Although there'd be more starter code to clean up.)

Using a terminal window, navigate to `SenchaTraining/workspace/Earthquakes/` and copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha app build development

This command processes `app.json`, creates a fresh copy of the microloader bootstrap files, and 
creates the stylesheet.


??Run the app

Run the app at <a href="http://localhost:1841/workspace/Earthquakes/" target="lab">http://localhost:1841/Earthquakes/</a>

It shows a map and a grid of tremors in Iceland. If you tap an item, an +Ext.toast()+ alert gived details on the event.

??Open the workspace in Sencha Studio

If you look in Studio you may *not* see the new app. That's because Studio doesn't readily see changes in the file system. 
If you don't see it, exit and re-enter Studio, and it should be there. 

In the Studio workspace tree, select `Workspace > Applications > Earthquakes > Tests` and, on the right, 
click `Initialize Test Project...`

??Launch the application

Select the `Earthquakes > Tests` project and, under `Scenarios`, check the `Launch application` checkbox.


??Create a test

In Studio, within `Applications > Earthquakes > Tests > Unit Tests` add a Jasmine Test Suite and call it `view/main/Main.js`

Then edit the test file &mdash; both the description and the spec. Just copy and paste this code:

<pre class="runnable 160 readonly">
describe("The selection", function() {

    it("updates the view model {selection} property", function() {
        expect(true).toBe(false);
    });

});</pre>


??Run the test

Run the test and verify that it fails.

??Make a recording

In Studio, within the `Earthquakes > Tests > Unit Tests` node, select and edit`view/main/Main.js`.
Remove the +expect(true).toBe(false);+ in the specification, and leave the cursor in specification function. Press the +Event Recorder+ button. 

<img src="resources/images/senchatest/StartRecording.jpg">

You'll be prompted to choose a browser &mdash; choose Chrome.

Once the app is running in Chrome, select the first row in the app's grid. You'll see the event in
Studio's +Event Recorder+ window. 

<img src="resources/images/senchatest/RecorderTapTheFirstRecord.jpg">

Click +Insert Event Recording+ and look at the resulting code. It should look something like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly 340">
describe("The selection", function() {

    it("updates the view model {selection} property", function() {

        ST.play([{
            type: "tap",
            target: "earthquakesgrid => [data-recordindex=\"0\"]",
            x: 16,
            y: 17
        }]);

    });

});
</pre>

??Add logic that looks at the view model

Eventually, you'll need to test a view model value after the row is selected. The +play+
array specifies the sequence of events being run. An array element can also be a function &mdash;
that's where you'll be adding code to look at the view model.

For now, replace the code in `Main.js` with this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
describe("The selection", function() {

    it("updates the view model {selection} property", function() {

        ST.play([{
            type: "tap",
            target: "earthquakesgrid => [data-recordindex=\"0\"]",
            x: 16,
            y: 17
        }, {
            fn: function() {
                var earthquake = Ext.first('main').getViewModel().get('earthquake');
                console.log(Ext.JSON.encode(earthquake.data));
                expect(true).toBe(false);
            }
        }]);

    });

});</pre>

The code gets the view model property and logs it. Sadly, the spec still fails due to the +expect(true).toBe(false);+, but 
in a later lab you'll change the code to compare the view model property against expected results.


??Run the app and look for the console log

Run the test in Studio and, with the debugger open in Chrome, look for the log message. It should look something like this:

    {"timestamp":"2016-03-15T16:34:20","latitude":65.131,"longitude":-16.357,"depth":6.1,"size":1.4,"quality":77.51,"humanReadableLocation":"4,8 km S af Her\u00f0ubrei\u00f0","id":"extModel49-40"}

Why not write tests against that data? Because the data changes from moment to moment. Therefore, you need an approach to mocking up the data, which will be covered next.
