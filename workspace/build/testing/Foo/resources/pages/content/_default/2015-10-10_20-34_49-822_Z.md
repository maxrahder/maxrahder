You'll use a navigation view to show the preview in the modern view of the tunes app.

An +Ext.navigation.View+ is a card-layout container implemented as a stack &mdash;
the top card is shown to the user. It has a top-docked titlebar.

Under program control, running +push()+ on the navigation view pushes a new card
onto the container. The new card becomes the top card and, therefore, is shown to the user.

You'll be making the modern main view a navigation view, whose first item is the list.
Then you'll detect a list tap, and drill down to show a page with the preview.
