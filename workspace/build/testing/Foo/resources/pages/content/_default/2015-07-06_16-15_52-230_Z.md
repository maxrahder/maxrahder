<p>
For example, if you had data for each month of the year you could use a category axis 
showing January, February, and so on through December. 
<p>
This is discrete because your data is for those values only, and not for intermediate values.
In other words, you will have a value for January or February, but not for "January and a half."

If your data were a continuum of any date, from January 1 through December 31, then you would use a time axis.
