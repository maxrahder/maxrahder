Sencha Test is designed to let you use your preferred testing framework, although
as of release 2.x only Jasmine is supported.

Jasmine is a Javascript test framework that lets you write sets of tests that 
compare your code's behavior against expected results. We'll discuss Jasmine in 
more detail later.

<pre class="runnable readonly 260">
// Your code
function helloWorld() {
  return 'Hello world!';
}

// A Jasmine test
describe('Hello world', function() {
  it('says hello', function() {
    expect(helloWorld()).toEqual('Hello world!');
  });
});</pre>
