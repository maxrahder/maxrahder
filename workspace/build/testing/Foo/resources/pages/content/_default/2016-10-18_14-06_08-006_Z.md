#Introduction

These are the setup instructions you received before class. Please make sure you 
have each of these items. If you don't, follow the corresponding instructions.

#Steps

??Create a course folder to hold your work

Create a folder to hold your work.

Windows: `C:\SenchaTest`

Mac/UNIX: `~/SenchaTest`


??Install Google Chrome

If you don't have Chrome, download and install it from <https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/>


??Install Sencha Cmd 6.2

To get the current version of Sencha Cmd, open a terminal window and type `sencha upgrade`. If Cmd is installed, it will start downloading the latest copy.
If Sencha Cmd is not installed you'll get a `command not found` message. 

If you don't have Cmd, or if your firewall prevents you from running `sencha upgrade`, you can install Cmd by downloading it from <https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/cmd-download/> &mdash; choose the option that *includes* the Java JRE. 


??Verify that the Jetty server works

Start the built-in Jetty server by opening a terminal window, navigating to the `SenchaTest` folder, and typing

    sencha web start 

After starting Jetty, you should see something like the following in the terminal window. Note that the server runs on port 1841.

    sencha web start
    Sencha Cmd v6.0.2.14
    [INF] Starting server on port 1841
    [INF] Mapping http://localhost:1841/ to ....
    
**Important**: Once you've started Jetty, you need to leave the terminal window open and running. 

When the server is running, use Chrome to visit <a href="http://localhost:1841" target="_blank">http://localhost:1841</a>.

You should see this page.

??Install Sencha Ext JS 6.2

Download Ext JS from <https://www.sencha.com/legal/gpl/>. (Note that if you use an ad blocker, it might block the download button.) 
Choose Sencha Ext JS, provide your email address, acknowledge the licensing terms, and click the `DOWNLOAD SDK` button.  

Unzip the SDK into the `SenchaTest` folder and change the SDK folder's name to `ext-6`. 

When you're finished you should have the following directory structure:

	SenchaTest
		ext-6
 
 
??Verify that Ext JS is installed

Test the Ext JS install by refreshing the page at <a href="http://localhost:1841" target="_blank">http://localhost:1841</a>. You should see a directory listing, 
including the new `ext-6` folder.

If you click on the `ext-6` directory you should see the Ext JS splash page.

??Install Node.js

Sencha Test Command-line Interface (STC) requires Node.js. You can find the Node.js installer at <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org/en/download/</a>.

		
??Install Sencha Test 2.0

Get the Sencha Test 2.0 installer and run it. Note that you should choose to install the Sencha Test CLI during the installation.

??You'll need a source code editor or IDE

You'll write a little code, so you'll need a source code editor. You're free to use the editor or integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice, such as Notepad++ (<https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>) or Atom (<https://atom.io/>).
