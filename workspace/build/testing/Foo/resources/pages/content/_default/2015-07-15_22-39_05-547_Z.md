For those of you who aren't familiar with the term *breadcrumb*, it comes from the
German fairytale *Hansel and Gretel*, published in 1812. In the story, a brother and 
sister go into a forest, and lay a trail of breadcrumbs in order to create a path they 
can later follow to find their way home. You can read about it in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansel_and_Gretel" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.
