#Introduction

In this lab you'll try making some async calls to the awesome Pokéapi &mdash; the RESTFUL Pokémon API.



#Steps


??Create a test scenario

In Studio, use the navigation tree to select the workspace-level Tests project, 
and add a scenario named *pokemon* in a directory of the same name. Set the test type to In-browser.

??Create a Jasmine test suite

In the navigation tree, right click on the `Workspace > Tests > pokemon` node and add a new Jasmine test suite named `Async.js`.

Replace the `Async.js` default code with this:

<pre class="runnable readonly 300">
describe("Pokemon data feed", function() {

    it("should pass", function() {
        expect(1).toBe(1);
    });

    it("should return Charizard\'s name", function() {
        // Do Ajax call, and look for the name in the response 
    });
    
});
</pre>

Run the `pokemon` scenario and you'll see that both tests pass. 

There is no matcher in the second spec, but if a spec doesn't expressly fail, Jasmine considers it to pass.

??Include Ext JS

You'll use +Ext.Ajax.request()+ to fetch the data, which means you need the Ext JS library. Sencha Studio 
is designed to be a generalized Javascript testing environment used to test any kind of web app. 

If you're testing an Ext JS application, the library will be included along with the rest of your app. 
But if you want to test some stand-alone code and use Ext JS in your tests, then you need to explicitly add the library.

Libraries can be added at the project level, or at the scenario level. In this case you're only adding it to the *pokemon* scenario.

To add the library, select the Tests project, then go to the *pokemon* scenario settings, click *Add Library* at the lower-right, and enter `../ext/build/ext-all.js` .

This is a relative URL, that points to the copy of Ext JS in the workspace's `ext` folder.


??Fetch the data

To make an Ajax call, use the +Ext.Ajax.request()+ method, passing a URL and a success callback. Use this code for `Async.js`:

<pre class="runnable readonly 380">
describe("Pokemon data feed", function() {

    it("should pass", function() {
        expect(1).toBe(1);
    });

    it("should return Charizard\'s name", function() {
        console.log('Making Ajax call');
        Ext.Ajax.request({
            url: 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/006/',
            success: function(xhr){
                var data = Ext.JSON.decode(xhr.responseText);
                console.log(data);
                expect(data.name).toBe('charizard');
            }
        });
    });

});</pre>

In Studio, select the `pokemon` scenario, run it, and both specs should still pass. The second test with 
the Ajax call passes because when it's called, no +expect+ statement is run. An +expect+ *is* run later, 
long after the call to the spec finishes, but without setting this up as an async spec, this call is ignored.

In Studio, look in the detail pane for output from the `should return Charizard's name` spec &mdash; there 
isn't any output, which means that the test still isn't being processed. 

Now look at the running app in the browser window that was spawned by Sencha Studio when you ran the scenario. 
Open Chrome Developer Tools, and look at the console. You'll see two things: the data being logged, and a run-time
error complaining that an +expect+ was encountered outside of a spec. 

<img src="resources/images/senchatest/DoneLabConsole.png"/>

If the Pokemon data is being logged, why isn't the +expect+ +expect(data.name).toBe('charizard');+ working?

The error says *'expect' was used when there was no current spec* &mdash; that means that the statement was
hit long after Jasmine completed the call to the spec. It wasn't until milliseconds later that the AJAX
call completed.


??Add the +done+

The purpose of +done+ is to let Jasmine know that the spec will time some time to complete, and you will
let Jasmine know when the test is done.

To do this, add a parameter to the spec (normally named +done+), which is a function reference. 

If you put +done+ as the parameter passed to the spec, Jasmine waits until the function 
is called before running the next spec. If done isn't called, the test is marked as a failure. 

Add the +done+ parameter to `Async.js` but, for now, don't call it.

<pre class="runnable readonly 380">
describe("Pokemon data feed", function() {

    it("should pass", function() {
        expect(1).toBe(1);
    });

    it("should return Charizard\'s name", function(done) {
        console.log('Making Ajax call');
        Ext.Ajax.request({
            url: 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/006/',
            success: function(xhr){
                var data = Ext.JSON.decode(xhr.responseText);
                console.log(data);
                expect(data.name).toBe('charizard');
            }
        });
    });

});</pre>

Run the tests, and note that it takes a while for the async spec to run. 
That's because Jasmine is waiting for your async code to complete.

Then, when it actually finishes, the spec fails because it times out. (Note that, in this case, it's not the matcher that is failing.)

??Call +done+ when you get the response


Add the call to +done+ in the success callback. 

<pre class="runnable readonly">
describe("Pokemon data feed", function() {

    it("should pass", function() {
        expect(1).toBe(1);
    });

    it("should return Charizard\'s name", function(done) {
        console.log('Making Ajax call');
        Ext.Ajax.request({
            url: 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/006/',
            success: function(xhr){
                var data = Ext.JSON.decode(xhr.responseText);
                console.log(data);
                expect(data.name).toBe('charizard');
                done(); // Hey Jasmine, I'm finished now!
            }
        });
    });

});</pre>

Run the test. If you still time out, it may be that it's taking longer than expected to get a response. Studio
defaults to waiting 5 seconds before timing out. 

You can change that by passing a third param to the +it+ call, specifying a time in milliseconds.

Modify the code to use the parameter. We're setting it to some unreasonably short time, just so 
you can see that it's failing.

<pre class="runnable readonly">
describe("Pokemon data feed", function() {

    it("should pass", function() {
        expect(1).toBe(1);
    });

    it("should return Charizard\'s name", function(done) {
        console.log('Making Ajax call');
        Ext.Ajax.request({
            url: 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/006/',
            success: function(xhr){
                var data = Ext.JSON.decode(xhr.responseText);
                console.log(data);
                expect(data.name).toBe('charizard');
                done(); // Hey Jasmine, I'm finished now!
            }
        }, 1000);
    });

});</pre>

Run it, and the test should fail with the message *Timeout waiting for test step to complete (1 sec).*

Remove the third parameter. Now try using the +Options+ toolbar button. Change the timeout to 15 seconds and run the suite. 
Your tests should pass!

??Add another spec

Now try it on your own. 

Add a new test spec that tests whether Charizard's weight is correct &mdash; it's supposed to be 905
*dags* (deca-grams). I.e., 90.5 kilos.

Copy the spec for Charizard's name, change the name of the spec, modify the matcher to test that the weight comes in as 905, 
and verify that both tests pass. 

??Move the Ajax call to +beforeEach+

Your code has two identical calls to fetch the data. To make that cleaner, add a +beforeEach+,
with a +done+ parameter, and save the data for later use by the individual specs. The specs no
longer need a +done+ parameter.

<pre class="runnable readonly">
describe("Pokemon data feed", function() {

    var data;

    beforeEach(function(done) {
        console.log('Making Ajax call');
        Ext.Ajax.request({
            url: 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/006/',
            success: function(xhr) {
                data = Ext.JSON.decode(xhr.responseText);
                done();
            }
        });
    });

    it("should pass", function() {
        expect(1).toBe(1);
    });

    it("should return Charizard\'s name", function() {
        expect(data.name).toBe('charizard');
    });
    
    it("should return Charizard\'s weight", function() {
        expect(data.weight).toBe(905);
    });

});
</pre>

If you run this, the tests should all still pass. Look at the log for the Chrome window running
the app: There are *three* pairs of Ajax calls being made. (Since it's a cross-domain AJAX call, 
each call goes in pairs &mdash; one call using the +OPTIONS+ request method, to get permission, and
the second call that actually fetches the data.) There are three specs, and +beforeEach+ is run 
before each spec, so there are a total of six calls.

That isn't necessarily bad. The point of +beforeEach+ is that the initialization used 
for one spec can't interfere with a different spec &mdash; each spec is initialized and run
independently.

??Move the Ajax call to +beforeAll+

In this case, you might claim that it's ok to fetch the data once. We're just reading the data.

Change the name of +beforeEach+ to +beforeAll+ and rerun the tests. They should all pass, but 
you'll only see one Ajax call.
