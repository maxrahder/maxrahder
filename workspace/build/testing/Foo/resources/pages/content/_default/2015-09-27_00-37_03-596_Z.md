In the last example, nothing seemed to happen. (Or, there was an error.)

That's because the code was run before the browser had 
finished loading the page. You can't run code that updates a web page before the page is loaded!

Try running the command on the debugger console. Open the debugger, and run the
same statement 

    Ext.Msg.alert('Hello world!', ':-)');

This time it worked, because it's been ages since the page was loaded.

So, for an app to work, you need to delay running your script until after the page load.
