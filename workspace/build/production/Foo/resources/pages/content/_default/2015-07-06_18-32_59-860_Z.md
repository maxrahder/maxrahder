In the last topic, we saw that +sencha app build+ creates a `.css` file. 

The build process also builds a `.js` file containing everything needed to run your application. By default,
the file is minimized. Use the +testing+ option to generate an un-minimized file.

Only classes used by your application are included. For example, if your application doesn't have a tree panel, then no tree panel classes are included.
