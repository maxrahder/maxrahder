1. Generate the Survey model using Sencha Cmd with specific data types

  +sencha generate model Survey firstName,lastName,emailAddress,useExtJS:boolean,useSenchaTouch:boolean,useGXT:boolean,startedUsingSencha:date,websiteUrl+

1. Modify the Survey model

  Update the Survey model with the +idProperty:'_id'+. The startedUsingSencha field +dateFormat:'U'+ as the date will be stored
  as UNIX epoch. 
  
1. Add a REST proxy to the model  

  The URL for the survey API is http://traininglabs.sencha.com/api/survey/touch/. You will use a REST proxy for this model to
  support GET/POST/PUT/DELETE HTTP methods.

  <pre>
Ext.define('YelpTouch.model.Survey', {
    extend: 'Ext.data.Model',
    config: {
        idProperty: '_id',
        fields: [
            { name: 'firstName', type: 'auto' },
            { name: 'lastName', type: 'auto' },
            { name: 'emailAddress', type: 'auto' },
            { name: 'useExtJS', type: 'boolean' },
            { name: 'useSenchaTouch', type: 'boolean' },
            { name: 'useGXT', type: 'boolean' },
            { name: 'startedUsingSencha', type: 'date', dateFormat: 'U'},
            { name: 'websiteUrl', type: 'auto' }

        ],
        proxy: {
            type: 'rest',
            url: 'http://traininglabs.sencha.com/api/survey/touch',
            reader: {
                type: 'json',
                rootProperty: 'data'
            }
        }
    }
});
  </pre>

1. Generate the controller for the Survey form

  +sencha generate controller Survey+

  Register the Survey controller with the app in +app.js+. This controller will be responsible for submitting our Survey form.

1. Modify the Survey controller

  Update the Survey controller to require the Survey model using the +models: []+. 
  
  Also create a reference which creates a +this.getSurveyView()+ method.
  
  Save and refresh the app to make sure there no errors on the developer Console.

1. Make the Survey view a Form Panel
 
  Modify the Survey view to extend from +Ext.form.Panel+.
  
  Now add the following snippet for the form fields and submit button:
  
 <pre>
 config: {
     defaults: {
         labelWidth: '40%'
     },
     items: [{
         xtype: 'textfield',
         name: 'firstName',
          label: 'First Name',
         placeHolder: 'Sencha',
         required: true
     }, {
         xtype: 'textfield',
         name: 'lastName',
         label: 'Last Name',
         placeHolder: 'Training',
         required: true
     }, {
         xtype: 'emailfield',
         name: 'emailAddress',
         label: 'E-mail Address',
         placeHolder: 'training@sencha.com',
         required: true
     }, {
         xtype: 'datepickerfield',
         label: 'When did you start using Sencha products?',
         labelAlign: 'top',
         name: 'startedUsingSencha',
         value: new Date()
     }, {
         xtype: 'fieldset',
         title: 'Sencha Products Used',
         instructions: 'Tell us what Sencha products you currently use.',
         defaults: {
             minValue: false,
             maxValue: true
         },
         items: [{
             xtype: 'togglefield',
             label: 'Ext JS',
             name: 'useExtJS'
         }, {
             xtype: 'togglefield',
             label: 'Sencha Touch?',
             name: 'useSenchaTouch'
         }, {
             xtype: 'togglefield',
             label: 'GXT?',
             name: 'useGXT'
         }]
     }, {
         xtype: 'urlfield',
         name: 'websiteUrl',
         label: 'Website',
         labelAlign: 'top',
         placeHolder: 'http://sencha.com/training'
     }, {
         xtype: 'button',
         itemId: 'submitButton',
         ui: 'action',
         text: 'Submit'
     }]
 }
 </pre>
  
  Save and refresh the application. You should see the form with the appropriate fields displayed for our Survey.
  ![](resources/images/_yelptouch/t_yelp13.png "border")  

  The console, should warn you about missing +requires+ items.
  Please fix these!

  Now is a good time to use the iOS Simulator or an actual device to test. If you notice, the keyboard changes
  layout as you tab between different input fields. Awesome!
  
1. Submit the form

  In the Survey controller, you need to listen for the Submit button +tap+ event. Here you need to look at the Survey view
  then attach a +tap+ listener to the Submit button (which has the +itemId:'submitButton'+). The name of the listener
  will be +onSubmitButtonTap+.
  
  Create the new controller method +onSubmitButtonTap+ so that it takes the +button+ as the first parameter.
  
  <pre>  
 onSubmitButtonTap: function(button) {
     console.log('onSubmitButtonTap');
 }
  </pre>
  
  Save and refresh the application to make sure you do not have any errors and the Submit button logs to the
  developer Console.
  
  Coding the logic for the form at this point is straight forward. You need to get the values from the form,
  create a new record with the survey data, and save the model to the server.
  
1. Get the values from the form:
 
    Since you created a reference, you can access the form using +this.getSurveyView()+. The form panel has a 
    +getValues()+ method which returns an object consisting of all the form field name/value pairs.
    
    +this.getSurveyView().getValues();+ // name/value pairs
    
    Let's go ahead and drop this into the +onSubmitButtonTap+ method and assign the return value to a variable:
    
    +var formValues = this.getSurveyView().getValues();+
    
1. Create a new model with the survey data
 
    Creating a model with an existing data object is really easy. If you will remember from the data package,
    you can pass in an object of the model field/values pairs. Which you already have that now in +formValues+.
    
    +var surveyRecord = Ext.create('YelpTouch.model.Survey', formValues);+
    
    Way-to-go!
    
1. Save the model to the server 
 
    All you **HAVE** to do is call the +Ext.data.Model.save()+ method to use the REST proxy. 
 This will POST the survey data to the server. However, you may want to be a little more robust.
    
    +surveyRecord.save()+
    
    The +save()+ method will take an additional callback function that returns the updated record (on success)
    and operation. This is useful to make sure you got a success from our server and to handle server responses
    and error codes gracefully.
    
    <pre>
 surveyRecord.save(function(record, operation) {
    if (operation.success) {
        Ext.Msg.alert('Survey saved.', 'Thanks for your entry!');
    } else {
        Ext.Msg.alert('Oops! Something went wrong!', 'Maybe you should look into it.');
    }
 });     
    </pre>
    
    This is good. Now you can show the user that the operation was successful or that an error occured when you
    submitted data to the server, but you can go one step further. The +operation+ parameter has a +.getReponse()+
    method returns the standard XmlHttpRequest response object. From here, you can use +Ext.decode+ to convert the
    +responseText+ into a JSON structure.
    
    The traininglabs.sencha.com Survey API was programmed to return +success: true+ if a record has
    been created or +success: false, msg: <reason>+ if the create failed. Here is the final +onSubmitButtonTap+
    method for the Survey controller.
 
    <pre>
 onSubmitButtonTap: function(button) {
     var formValues = this.getSurveyView().getValues();
     var surveyRecord = Ext.create('YelpTouch.model.Survey', formValues);
     surveyRecord.save(function(record, operation) {
         if (operation.success) {
             Ext.Msg.alert('Survey saved.', 'Thanks for your entry!');
         } else {
             Ext.Msg.alert('Oops! Something went wrong!', 'Maybe we should look into it.');
         }
     });
 }
 </pre>
 
    Save and test your form! Take a look into the network tab to see the messages you are posting.
    Try again to submit the same message. Did you see an error message?

## Challenge

You can optimize this form with client-side validation. In Sencha Touch, you can solve this via the Model.
    Browse back through the data package slides, and see if you can build it in!
