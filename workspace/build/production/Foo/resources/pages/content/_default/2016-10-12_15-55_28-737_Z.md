As a developer, when you create a test scenario, you choose whether the tests are run
using Selenium WebDriver or in one of your local browsers.

<div type="expander" caption="WebDriver">
The +WebDriver+ option runs your tests in isolation from Ext and from your application namespace. 
This type of testing is suitable for user- or application-tests in which the tests &mdash; by design &mdash;
treat the application as a black box. Such tests are limited to the ST API. 
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="In-browser">
Choosing the +In-browser+ option means that Studio launches the application in your chosen browser &mdash; or you can choose to test across 
multiple browsers. Your application namespace and the Ext methods are available within your tests. This is suitable for unit-,
integration- and application-tests, where your tests intentionally reference application and Ext classes
and methods.
