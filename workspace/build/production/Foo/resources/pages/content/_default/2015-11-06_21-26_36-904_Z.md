A function statement is a JavaScript statement that begins with the keyword +function+.

Functions statements must include a name. The name is optional with function expressions. 
If named, the function can be referenced within the function. The name also helps with 
debugging.

At compile time, function *statements* are expanded into *expressions*. 

<pre class="runnable 300">// A function statement
function foo(){
    console.log('foo');
}

// The compiler does this
var foo; 

// Then at runtime this happens.
foo = function foo(){
    console.log('foo');
};
</pre>

Function initizations are done before variable initializations. Also, although 
allowed by some browsers, it's a bad idea to code a function statement within 
an +if+ or +else+ &mdash; the result is undefined, and therefore, inconsistent 
among browsers.
