Hoisting is a a metaphore that helps illustrate the behavior of
function-level scope. Variables aren't literally hoisted, but the
idea can help programmers used to the "from point of declaration" 
scope rule used by some other languages. 

Think of the earlier example. The hoisting effect is the result of the compile
pass happening first, and processing all the +var+ and +function+ statements

<pre>
<b>var a</b><span style="color:#999999"> = 1;</span>
<b>function foo</b>(<b>bar</b>){
    <b>var a</b><span style="color:#999999"> = 1;</span>
    <b>var b</b><span style="color:#999999"> = 2;</span>
    <b>c</b> <span style="color:#999999">= 3;</span>
}
<span style="color:#999999">foo();</span></pre>
