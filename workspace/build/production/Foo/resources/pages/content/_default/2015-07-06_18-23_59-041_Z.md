Ext JS soft-codes strings shown to the user. Those values are coded as properties, which 
can be overwritten by loading one of the locale files that ship with Ext JS.

Ext JS ships with over 40 locale files, found in the 
`packages/ext-locale/build/` folder, such as `ext-lang-de.js`, `ext-lang-fr.js` and many others.
