To use app caching, edit `app.json` and configure the `app.js`
asset.


    "js": [{
        "path": "app.js",
        "bundle": true,
        "update": "delta"
    }]



- +"update":"full"+ releads the entire `app.js` 
- +"update":"delta"+ only reloads what was changed, which is especially important for mobile devices, where bandwidth
is limited
