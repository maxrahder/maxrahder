#Introductions

In this lab, you will set up the starter YelpExtplorer application.

#Steps

??Review the student folder
 
The student folder holds the source code for YelpExtplorer

    SenchaTraining
        labs
            yelpextplorer
                app
                classic
                modern
                sass
        labsolutions
            yelpextplorer

The `labs/yelpextplorer` folder holds the source and sass files for YelpExtplorer. It has
the code for a classic user interface, but no code for modern.

??Generate the starter application
 
In the terminal window, navigate to the `SenchaTraining/ext-6` folder and enter this:
    
    sencha generate app YelpExtplorer ../labs/yelpextplorer
    
??Clean up the code

A starter app has some files we don't care about. 

Delete these files from the `app` folder:

- `app/store/Personnel.js`
- `app/view/main/MainController.js` (do *not* deleted the copy that has *Shared* in the name)
- `app/view/main/MainModel.js` (do *not* deleted the copy that has *Shared* in the name)

Delete these files from the `classic` and `modern` folders:

- `classic/src/view/main/List.js`
- `classic/src/view/main/Main.js`
- `modern/src/view/main/List.js`
- `modern/src/view/main/Main.js`

Rename the saved main view to `Main.js`

- Rename `classic/src/view/main/Main_save.js` to `Main.js`
- Rename `modern/src/view/main/Main_save.js` to `Main.js`

<br>
After you've finished deleting and renaming things, you need to let the microloader know about the 
changes by using a terminal window to navigate to `SenchaTraining/labs/yelpextplorer` and entering

    sencha app refresh

 
??Start the server
 
Use a terminal window to stop your server, if it's already running

    sencha web stop

Then use a terminal navigate to `SenchaTraining` and enter

    sencha web start

This starts the server. The terminal window is used for the server, so leave it open and running.


??Run the classic application
 
In your browser, open the newly application via <a href="localhost:1841/labs/yelpextplorer" target="lab">localhost:1841/labs/yelpextplorer</a>.

If you run it as a classic app, it shows a map, grid and list. If you select an business, details on the
business are shown on the right. Entering a city or category at the top results in new businesses being 
fetched.

??Run the modern application

Within Chrome, to run an application as a modern app, you either use device emulation (from the 
Developer Tools toolbar), or add `?modern` to the URL.

There's not much in the moden application &mdash; it's just a container with its +html+ set to *Modern UI*.

??Review binding and flow of the classic application

Re-run the appliation as a classic app, and try typing in a city or category. 

Look at `classic/view/main/Main.js` and note how the filter is coded. It's docked at the top,
and bound to *typedCity* and *typedCategory*. As the user types, those values are pushed onto 
the view model.

Look at the +initViewModel+ method in `app/view/main/MainControllerShared.js`. Note that as 
*typedCity* and *typedCategory* change, the *city* and *category* properties change. And as
*city* and *category* change, the *businesses* store is loaded. 

Look at `classic/view/businesses/TabPanel.js`. The map, grid, and view are 
using the *businesses* store. As the store changes, they update automatically.
Those components are also set up to push their selection (which is a business record) to the 
view model *business* property. 

Look at `classic/view/main/Main.js` and note how the east panel is coded. As *business*
changes, the east panel's *data* setter is run. 

Look at `classic/view/business/Detail.js`. A component's template is updated as its +setData()+
is run. So the flow is: As the user selects a business, the view model *business* changes. As
that changes the detail panel's +setData()+ method is run, passing in the business record, and
the record's values are used in the template.

??Think about the modern binding

How much of the common controller and view model can the modern UI use? Everything! 
When you
code the modern UI, as long as you wire up the text fields to *typedCity* and *typedCategory*, 
and bind the map and list *selection* to *business*, it should all work.
