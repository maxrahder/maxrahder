#Introduction

In this lab, you'll overlay the starter app with the full application infrastructure
provided by Sencha Cmd.

#Steps

??Clean up the starter code

Using the file system or your IDE, delete `earthquakes/index.html`


??Generate the app

Using a terminal window, navigate to `SenchaTraining/ext-6/` and copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha generate app -classic -starter=false Earthquakes ../labs/earthquakes

- The +-classic+ parameter means only the classic toolkit is used. 
- The +-starter=false+ parameter means that the normal starter app will be omitted. 
- *Earthquakes* is the name of the app &mdash; it's the namespace and prefix for all classes. 
- `../labs/earthquakes` is the relative path to the folder where the app is generated. 

The `labs/earthquakes` folder already exists, which means the existing code will be preserved.


??Initialize the microloader

Since we omitted creating the normal starter app, you need to initialize the microloader
and generate the initial stylesheet. If we had started with the normal starter app, this
wouldn't be needed. (Although there'd be more starter code to clean up.)

Using a terminal window, navigate to `labs/earthquakes/` and copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha app build development

This command processes `app.json`, creates a fresh copy of the microloader bootstrap files, and creates the stylesheet.


??Run the app

Refresh your browser window. The app should still run.
