The notion of having expected results before writing code dates to the 
earliest days of computer programming, but the modern notion came out of
the Extreme Programming movement 

Test-driven programming dictates that **tests are written before the code**, 
and then the code is written iteratively until the tests are passed. 

This method helps programmers address the principle of "you aren't gonna need it" 
by focusing on writing only the code necessary to pass tests. Thus, code is cleaner, 
and avoids extraneous features.
