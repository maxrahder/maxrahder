If you're running on OSX, there's another great debugging technique:

1. Use a lightning cable to connect your iPhone or iPad to your computer
2. On your iPhone/iPad, ensure that WebInspector is enabled
    -   Choose `Settings > Safari > Advanced. ` Make sure Web Inspector is enabled.

    - Choose `Develop > [device] > [app]` (The iOS emulator will also be listed.)
