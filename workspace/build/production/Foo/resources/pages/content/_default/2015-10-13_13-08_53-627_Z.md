The “Secure Databases” tab allows you to inspect the secure databases, tables, and rows of an application running within 
Sencha Web Application Manager. Web Application Manager specifically gives you access to Secure Databases, which makes 
this all possible.

NOTE: The Secure Databases tab may be disabled because Secure Databases are only available inside the Sencha Web Application 
Manager. This is disabled for the Demo application.

We will not be delving into this in class.
