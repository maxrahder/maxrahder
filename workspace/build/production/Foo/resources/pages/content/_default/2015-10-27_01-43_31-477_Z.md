#Introduction

In this lab, you'll see where the templates can be customized to fit your needs.

One of the benefits of a well-crafted plugin, is that you can alter it to be
whatever you want it to be. We have seen how you can turn on or off functionality. 
You also have the ability to take the initial templates and alter them to whatever 
you would like.

I was bothered by comments placed inside block comments that would then be uncovered if 
you took the commenting away. You may be bothered by not having an xtype by default 
(or too many comments, or whatever).

?? Editing a File Template

**File > New >Edit File Templates**

?? Alter a Template

We'll alter a view. Edit the view template and either move the comment, remove it or uncover the xtype. 
The next time you enter the area, it will be highlighted in a different color indicating that it has been changed.

?? Making Additional Code Templates

You can also select any of the existing snippets and use the copy icon at the top left to make your own templates.
