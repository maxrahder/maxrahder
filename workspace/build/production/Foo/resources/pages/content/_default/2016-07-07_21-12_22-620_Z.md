After you choose the service, you add browser *pools* &mdash; a pool is a set of browsers you want to test against.

To create the pool, right-click on the browser farm node on the left. Then name the pool and specify a location for 
its configuration. Then use the center panel to add browsers. The right panel lets you specify the run-time OS, 
browser version and other browser details.
