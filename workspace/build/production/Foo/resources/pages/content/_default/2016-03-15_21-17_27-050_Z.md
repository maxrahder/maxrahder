The modern toolkit has an +Ext.Map+ class that's a wrapper around a Google map. To use
it, you need to include the Google Maps library in your `index.html`.

One of the key properties of +Ext.Map+ is +mapOptions+, which is the 
<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference#MapOptions" target="_blank">MapOptions 
specification</a> sent to the map as it's created.

<pre class="runnable modern readonly">
// This won't run in the iframe, because it doesn't include the Google Maps library.

Ext.define('MyApp.view.Main', {
    extend: 'Ext.Map',
    useCurrentLocation: true,
    mapOptions: {
        zoom: 7
    }
});
Ext.application({
    name: 'MyApp',
    mainView: 'MyApp.view.Main'
});

</pre>
