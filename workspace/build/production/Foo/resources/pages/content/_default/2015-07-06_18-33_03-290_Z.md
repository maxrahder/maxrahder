#Converting a Manually Created Application

You can only use +sencha app build+ on an application created using Cmd. 

To convert an application you hand-coded, into an application you can build:

- Create a new folder &mdash; this will become the application root folder
* Copy your application's resources to the new folder
* Copy your application's `app/` folder to the new folder
* Use Cmd to generate a new application with the same name as your application, using the new folder as the location
* Modify `Application.js` and `app.json` , if necessary
* Recreate the application's bootstrap files via +sencha app refresh+

This procedure only works if your application is property structured according to
Sencha's <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/cmd/5.x/cmd_compiler.html" target="api">Compiler-Friendly Code Guidelines</a>.
