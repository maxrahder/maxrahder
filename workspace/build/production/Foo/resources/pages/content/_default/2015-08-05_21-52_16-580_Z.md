#Introduction

This lab will let you create and modify toolbars and docked items.

#Steps

??Try adding a toolbar at the top

Edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and add this config: 

    tbar: [{
        text: 'Button'
    }]


Note that this does not specify the xtype of the item. The default xtype for toolbar
items is *button*, so this code creates a button.

Save and refresh your browser and you should see the button at the top.

??Add a second toolbar

Edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and copy and paste the +tbar+ config, so there are two identical toolbars configs.
 
Save your changes, refresh your browser and you'll see a *single* toolbar. 
 
That because the config is an object with name-value pairs; there can only be a single value 
for a given name. So the second value overwrites the first.

Change the second toolbar to be a +bbar+, save and refresh. You should see two toolbars. Try 
using +rbar+ and +lbar+ too.

??Add the toolbar using +dockedItems+

The banner is docked at the top via +dockedItems+. Toolbars created via +tbar+ (or +bbar+, etc.) are
also docked items. Mixing +dockedItems+ with +tbar+ configs can be error prone because the order of
creation may not be obvious to whomever is maintaining your code. Therefore, with multiple
items docked in a given position, it can be more explicit to use +dockedItems:[]+ &mdash; the order of
the items is the same as the order in the array.

Remove the +tbar+ configs that you added, and add a second item to +dockedItems+:

    dockedItems: [{
        dock: 'top',
        xtype: 'banner'
    }, {
        xtype: 'toolbar',
        dock: 'top',
        items: [{
            text: 'Button'
        }]
    }],

This code is more verbose than using +tbar+ because you have to fully configure the toolbar, including 
using the xtype and +items:[]+. 

Save and refresh to make sure everything still works.


??Create a toolbar class to hold the city and category text fields</kbd>

YelpExtplorer needs a toolbar that has text fields for city and category.
Eventually, the list of Yelp results will reflect what the user types.

Create a file named
`app/view/businesses/Filter.js`. Use this code:

<pre class="runnable 280">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.Filter', {
    extend: 'Ext.toolbar.Toolbar',
    xtype: 'businessesfilter',
    items: [{
        xtype: 'textfield',
        fieldLabel: 'City',
        labelWidth: 26
    }],
    padding: 4
});
</pre>    


??Use the toolbar class

Edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and remove the second docked item (the toolbar) and any +tbar+, +bbar+, +lbar+
or +rbar+ configs you might have lying around.

Add a requires for `YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.Filter`, and add a second docked 
item using the new toolbar xtype. When you're finished, the main view should look like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.Main', {
    extend: 'Ext.panel.Panel',
    xtype: 'app-main',

    requires: [
        'Ext.plugin.Viewport',

        'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainController',
        'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel',
        'YelpExtplorer.view.Banner',
        'YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.TabPanel',
        'YelpExtplorer.view.business.Detail',
        'YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.Filter'
    ],

    controller: 'main',
    viewModel: 'main',
    dockedItems: [{
        dock: 'top',
        xtype: 'banner'
    }, {
        dock: 'top',
        xtype: 'businessesfilter'
    }],
    layout: 'border',
    items: [{
        region: 'center',
        xtype: 'businessestabpanel'
    }, {
        region: 'east',
        xtype: 'businessdetail',
        width: 130
    }]

});
</pre>
    
Save your changes and refresh your browser. You should see the city text field at the top.

??Add the category field

Edit `app/view/businesses/Filter.js` and add another text field to +items:[]+. Set its label
to *Category*. Save and refresh, and see how it looks. Adjust the +labelWidth+ as needed.

Even with properly sized labels, the two text fields end up being a little too close together.
Therefore, add an +Ext.toolbar.Spacer+ component between them. Recall from lecture that there
are a couple of ways of creating a spacer &mdash; create the spacer using its xtype, then try
using the convenience string literal. 

When you are finished the application should look like this:

#Conclusion
 
You used +tbar+, +bbar+, +rbar+ and +lbar+ to create a toolbar with one button. You also docked
two items in the same position using +dockedItems+, and you created an +Ext.toolbar.Toolbar+ subclass
to hold the city and category text fields.
