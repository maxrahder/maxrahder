#Introduction

In this lab, you'll generate the initial app for the project.

??Start the server

If you haven't already done so, make sure the server is running at the `SenchaTraining`
folder.

To start the server, open a terminal window and navigate to the `SenchaTraining` folder. 
Then copy and paste this command:
    
    sencha web start


??Generate the app

Using a terminal window, navigate to `ext-6` and copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha generate app -modern -starter=false ISS ../labs/iss

The +-modern+ parameter means only the modern toolkit is used. 


??Create the main view

Using a terminal window, navigate to `labs/iss/` and copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha generate view main.Main

Then, edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and change the +extend+
to +Ext.Container+ &mdash; a container is a good generic starting point
for the viewport.

Also give it +xtype:'mainview'+.

When you are finished, the `Main.js` should look like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly 340">
Ext.define('ISS.view.main.Main', {
    extend: 'Ext.Container',
    xtype: 'mainview',

    requires: [
        'ISS.view.main.MainController',
        'ISS.view.main.MainModel'
    ],

    controller: 'main-main',
    viewModel: {
        type: 'main-main'
    },

    html: 'Hello, World!!'
});
</pre>

??Create `Application.js`

Then, create the file `app/Application.js` with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly 300">
Ext.define('ISS.Application', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.Application',
    name: 'ISS',
    onAppUpdate: function () {
        Ext.Msg.confirm('Application Update', 'This application has an update, reload?',
            function (choice) {
                if (choice === 'yes') {
                    window.location.reload();
                }
            }
        );
    }
});
</pre>

The +onAppUpdate+ method is used by the microloader to let the user know
when the cached application has changed.

If you had created the normal starter code, the main view would have
been a tab panel, and `app/Application.js` would already be there. 
Cleaning up the starter code takes about the same effort as starting
with an empty project and creating your own initial views.

??Edit `app.js`

The initial `app.js` simply shows an alert in its +launch+ method. We need it to 
show the main view. It also needs to extend the +Application+ class you created 
in the previous step.

Edit `app.js` and replace its contents with this code:
<pre class="runnable readonly 180">
Ext.application({
    name: 'ISS',
    extend: 'ISS.Application',
    requires: ['ISS.view.main.Main'],
    mainView: 'ISS.view.main.Main'
});
</pre>


??Initialize the microloader

In your terminal window for `labs/iss/`, copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha app build development

As you may recall, this command processes `app.json` and creates a fresh 
copy of the microloader bootstrap files, and also creates a CSS file for
your app.

??Run the app

Visit <a href="localhost:1841/labs/iss" target="lab">localhost:1841/labs/iss</a>.
You should see *Hello World!!* from the main view.
