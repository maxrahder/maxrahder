You can run `sencha app watch` from the IDE, negating the need for toggling from the console to the terminal and back to the IDE

In addition: 

- you can receive immediate in-IDE alert of build compilation errors

    This allows you to see compilation errors as they occur and address them in real-time.

- you can name a configuration to run accordingly later:

From the Upper right hand corner:

    Edit Configurations  > Sencha App Watch
