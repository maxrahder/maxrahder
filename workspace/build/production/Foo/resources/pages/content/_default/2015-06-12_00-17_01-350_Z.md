The +Ext.callParent(arguments);+ passes *arguments*, which is an array-like 
variable automatically created by JavaScript. It holds all the parameters 
passed into a function. 

Calling +this.callParent(arguments);+ is another way of saying 
"Call the ancestor method, passing everything that was passed to me."

It's a good idea to always use that form in any situation where you 
are overriding an initialization method.
