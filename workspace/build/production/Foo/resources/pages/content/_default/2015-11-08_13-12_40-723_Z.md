A site many of have found helpful is the <a href="https://color.adobe.com/ " target="_blank">Color</a>site from Adobe
, it allows someone without graphics skills to fairly quickly grab the appropriate colors to brand a site.

All you need to do is supply your adobe id to save items to the page. 

NOTE: This is the same identification you would have created if you have ever downloaded any trial software from their site.

?? Creating a Color scheme from the image

In Color, click on the Create button on the top left and then choose the camera icon on the right. 
Navigate to the file you just downloaded. It will open up in the window and on the left is a list of 
color moods. These will pick colors from the image you uploaded automatically. You can also select the 
circles and drag them directly over the colors you wish to sample. Once you are satisfied, choose the Save
button on the left.

?? Using your theme

Click on MyThemes, on the next window choose Edit Copy. You will be taken to the screen below. You now
have the hexadecimal and rgb values of a logo that can used in your theming. With a little more work, you can 
even build themes and shades off of individual colors in yout theme. You are now "stylin."
