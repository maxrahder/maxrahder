Ext.toast() is a convenience method for lightweight, auto-dismissing pop-up notifications. Each call to +Ext.toast()+ is a new
instance of +Ext.window.Toast+, which is automatically destroyed after being shown.

<pre class="runnable 160">
Ext.toast('The Mighty Moose');
</pre>

<pre class="runnable 160">
// Third parameter options: br bl tr tl t l b r
Ext.toast('The Mighty Moose', 'Alces alces', 't'); // Message, title, position
</pre>

Why is it called *toast*? Maybe because it pops up.
