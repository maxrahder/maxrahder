Sometimes you *want* to see the optimized CSS while in development, to test and verify
how the application styling looks using the built style sheet.

But during development, it's easier to be able to see component styling as you add new
components. 

Therefore, even when you need a production or testing build, you may then 
do a development build before you continue to work on the application.
