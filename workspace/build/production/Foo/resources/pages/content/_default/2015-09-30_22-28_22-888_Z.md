#Introduction

In this lab, you'll see two-way binding in action.

#Steps


<div type="expander" caption="Bind the map and grid to the same property">

Both the +Earthquakes.view.Grid+ and +Earthquakes.view.Map+ classes publish the selection.
That means that within those classes, as the user selects a marker or a row in the
grid, the selected record is passed to the +setSelection()+ methods. Because *selection*
is published, the value is automatically pushed to a bound view model property.

Edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and add this to the binding for both the map and grid:

        selection: '{earthquake}'

When you are finished the class will look like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('Earthquakes.view.main.Main', {
    extend: 'Ext.panel.Panel',
    xtype: 'main',
    requires: [
        'Earthquakes.view.Grid',
        'Earthquakes.view.Map',
        'Earthquakes.view.main.MainModel',
        'Earthquakes.view.main.MainController',
        'Ext.plugin.Viewport',
        'Ext.window.Toast'
    ],
    viewModel: {
        type: 'main'
    },
    controller: 'main',
    layout: 'border',
    title: 'Earthquakes in Iceland',
    items: [{
        xtype: 'earthquakesmap',
        region: 'north',
        flex: 1,
        location: {
            latitude: 64.9312762,
            longitude: -19.021169
        },
        split: true,
        listeners: {
            select: 'onSelect'
        },
        bind: {
            store: '{earthquakes}',
            selection: '{earthquake}'
        }
    }, {
        xtype: 'earthquakesgrid',
        region: 'center',
        bind: {
            store: '{earthquakes}',
            selection: '{earthquake}'
        }
    }]
});
</pre>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Try it out">

Save and refresh your browser. If you select an item from the map, it will become selected on the grid. If you
select an item from the grid, it will become selected on the map (and consequently, the toast will appear).

How is this working? As you select an item on the grid, the grid class runs its +setSelection()+
method. Since that property is published, the value is automatically pushed to the bound property *earthquake*.
The map is also bound to *earthquake*, so as the view model property changes, the map's +setSelection()+
method is run. The reverse sequence happens when you select an item on the map.
