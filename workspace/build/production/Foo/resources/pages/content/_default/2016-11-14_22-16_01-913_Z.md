The Ext JS library has already been tested. Therefore, you don't need
to verify that it works.<sup>*</sup> For example, if you have a +config+ property
in a class, you don't need to test that running the setter is reflected
by the getter.

If you use a component in one of your view classes, you need to test your 
use of it. For example, if clicking on a button should result in changing a view 
model property, then verify that. But you don't need to test that buttons, in 
general, fire +click+.



<div style="margin-top: 3em; font-size: 60%; line-height: 1.2em;">
* Yes, there will be occasional bugs in the framework, but there are 
simply too many components and too many methods to try to test them yourself.
