Production builds are placed in the workspace's `build/production/` folder. 
Testing builds are in the `build/testing/` folder.

The `app.js` file contains all JavaScript needed by your application. The `resources/MyApp-all.css`
file holds your application's stylesheet. The `index.html` references those files.
