#Introduction

In this lab, you will better encapsulate the filter toolbar.

#Steps

??Plan what you'll be doing

Binding the text fields on *{city}* and *{category}* works fine. But the code could be more object-oriented. 

Think of the filter panel in terms of a UML diagram. A class that implements the UML should have two 
properties &mdash; *city* and *category* &mdash; accessed via getters and setters. 

<img src="resources/images/yelp/FilterUML.jpg">

Currently, the toolbar has strange coupling. It's in the main view's +items:[]+, but the toolbar is unilaterally
updating the main view's view model. Instead, the main view should control which of its view model properties are 
being updated.

If the main view could talk, it would say *I control how my view model properties are changed. I may do that
by listning to events, and have my event handlers update those properties, or I may use binding, and specify
what properties are updated. The views I create in my items array should have no idea what properties I
need, so those views should not update properties on their own.*

In this lab, you'll change the code to have better encapsulation and abstraction. In the revised version,
the filter toolbar will have *city* and *category* properties, and any container using the toolbar is 
free to bind on those, if needed. 

(Frankly, in this case, it's probably easier to just leave the bindings on the text fields.
But going through the process of encapsulating the properties will teach you the technique.)


??Add the properties

In the Ext JS class system, properties are normally added via a +config+ in the class descriptor.
You'll do that too, but you'll use a special form of +config+. 

Edit `app/view/businesses/Filter.js` and add this class descriptor:

    renderConfig: {
        city: '',
        category: ''
    }

A +renderConfig+ is like a normal +config+, except the values aren't applied until the view is rendered. 

??Remove the bindings within the class

Continue to edit `app/view/businesses/Filter.js` and remove the bindings in the city and category
fields. 

Since we're encapsulating things, the binding will be done higher up the containment hierarchy.
You'll do that later in the lab.


??Update the toolbar user interface as the city changes

With the +renderConfig+ the class system will automatically provide setters and getters
for the two new properties. So what should happen if the setter is run? The toolbar should 
update the value of the text field. And similarly, if the text field gets changed, it 
should push the value to any code that's listening.

To do this, first code an update method for city. Recall from the lecture on the class system that
any config property is given four methods: get, set, apply and update. The update method is used for
side-effects. In this case, whenever city changes, you want to update the text field.

Add this method to `app/view/businesses/Filter.js`:

    updateCity: function (city) {
        this.lookupReference('city').setValue(city);
    }

For this code to work, you need to add +reference:'city'+ to the city field's config. And 
for the lookup to work you need to configure the toolbar container so it sees the references 
via +referenceHolder:true+ (This happens automatically with views that have controllers.)

Here's how the class should end up:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.Filter', {
    extend: 'Ext.toolbar.Toolbar',
    xtype: 'businessesfilter',
    renderConfig: {
        city: '',
        category: ''
    },
    updateCity: function (city) {
        this.lookupReference('city').setValue(city);
    },
    referenceHolder: true,
    items: [{
        xtype: 'textfield',
        reference: 'city',
        fieldLabel: 'City',
        labelWidth: 26
    }, '', {
        xtype: 'textfield',
        fieldLabel: 'Category',
        labelWidth: 56
    }],
    padding: 4
});
</pre>

??Test the setter

You can test the setter out by saving your changes, refreshing your browser, then typing this in the
debugger console:

    var filter = Ext.first('businessesfilter');
    filter.setCity('Tombstone, Arizona');

You should see the city name change to Tombstone, Arizona.

But the map didn't center itself. Why? Because the class isn't set up to push key
values onto a view model.

??Publish the city and category

Classes gain the ability to push values onto a view model via +publishes:[]+.

Edit `app/view/businesses/Filter.js` and add this class descriptor: 

    publishes: ['city', 'category']
    
Published properties are pushed to the view model when their corresponding setters are run.

Edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and change the docked item config for the filter panel to do the
binding there:

    dockedItems: [{
        dock: 'top',
        xtype: 'banner'
    }, {
        xtype: 'businessesfilter',
        bind: {
            city: '{city}'
        }
    }]

Save your changes, refresh your browser, and test it like you did before, by typing this into the debugger console:

    var filter = Ext.first('businessesfilter');
    filter.setCity('Tombstone, Arizona');

After waiting a second, because of the buffered call to the geocode routine, the map should center
on Tombstone.

This works because you're running the setter on the console. Since *city* is published, and the main
view is binding that property to *{city}* in the view model, running the setter results in the view
model being updated.

??Have the filter class run +setCity()+

Rather than running +setCity()+ from the console, you want the setter to be run as the user types. 
Therefore, change the config for the city text field as follows:

    {
        xtype: 'textfield',
        reference: 'city',
        fieldLabel: 'City',
        listeners: {
            change: function (field) {
                field.up('businessesfilter').setCity(field.getValue());
            }
        },
        labelWidth: 26
    }

This code runs the setter on the filter as the user types. Save and refresh, then 
type a city &mdash; after a second the map should center on the city.

??Set up category the same way

The UML shows that the class has both *city* and *category* properties. But so far you've
only implemented *city*. You need to do the same thing for category. Here's the finished
code:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.Filter', {
    extend: 'Ext.toolbar.Toolbar',
    xtype: 'businessesfilter',
    renderConfig: {
        city: '',
        category: ''
    },
    publishes: ['city', 'category'],
    updateCity: function(city) {
        this.lookupReference('city').setValue(city);
    },
    updateCategory: function(category) {
        this.lookupReference('category').setValue(category);
    },
    referenceHolder: true,
    items: [{
        xtype: 'textfield',
        reference: 'city',
        fieldLabel: 'City',
        listeners: {
            change: function(field) {
                var filter = field.up('businessesfilter');
                filter.setCity(field.getValue());
            }
        },
        labelWidth: 26
    }, '', {
        xtype: 'textfield',
        reference: 'category',
        fieldLabel: 'Category',
        listeners: {
            change: function(field) {
                var filter = field.up('businessesfilter');
                filter.setCategory(field.getValue());
            }
        },
        labelWidth: 56
    }],
    padding: 4
});
</pre>

Note the +renderConfig+, the +updateCategory()+, and the listener on the category text field.

Now edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and modify the toolbar config to add a binding for *category*:

    dockedItems: [{
        dock: 'top',
        xtype: 'banner'
    }, {
        xtype: 'businessesfilter',
        bind: {
            city: '{city}',
            category: '{category}'
        }
    }],

Save and refresh. Enter a city again to make sure that still works. You can test that the category 
is being pushed onto the view model by typing something in the category field, then from the command 
line typing:

    Ext.first('app-main').getViewModel().get('category');
    
You should see the category on the console, which proves that the view model reflects 
the value in the category text field.



??Optional challenge &mdash; a comparison of binding and event handling

Rather than using +publishes+ and binding, you can use +listeners+ and events. 

Edit `app/view/businesses/Filter.js` and change the city field's *change* listener function
like this:

    {
        xtype: 'textfield',
        reference: 'city',
        fieldLabel: 'City',
        listeners: {
            change: function (field) {
                var filter = field.up('businessesfilter');
                filter.setCity(field.getValue());
                filter.fireEvent('cityChange', filter, field.getValue());
            }
        },
        labelWidth: 26
    }

As the user types, the code tells whatever is listening that the city has changed.

Then edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and change the config for the filter toolbar like this:

    dockedItems: [{
        dock: 'top',
        xtype: 'banner'
    }, {
        xtype: 'businessesfilter',
        listeners: {
            cityChange: function(filter, value){
                console.log(value);
            }
        },
        bind: {
            city: '{city}',
            category: '{category}'
        }
    }]

Save, refresh, and enter a city &mdash; as you type you'll see the console message.
In practice you'd put an +onCityChange+ handler in the view controller, and have it 
do the geocoding. 

Events and listeners provide an alternative to binding. Bindings are generally more convenient, 
but bindings can only be used when a property changes, whereas event handling can be any event 
&mdash; there is no way to bind for things like a user *click*.

Your app doesn't need the event, so feel free to delete the +listeners+ on businessesfilter.


#Conclusion

You achieved good encapsulation and abstraction by using features of the 
class system and +Ext.mixin.Bindable+. 

The class system provides +config+ properties that have automatically-generated get, set, 
apply, and update methods. Using accessor methods hides implementation details. 

The +publishes+ config lets you push values onto a view model as the setter is run.

You also saw how to accomplish the same thing via a custom event.
