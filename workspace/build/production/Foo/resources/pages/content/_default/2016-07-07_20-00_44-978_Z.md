`stc server` is the command for launching the archive server. 

In addition, on Unix you also need to make it an executable file by using a 
terminal window to visit `~/bin/Sencha/Test/1_0_3_34/stc/` (using your install
version number) and making `stc` executable via <code>chmod +x stc</code>

Once it's set up, just use a terminal window and navigate to the folder
holding `storage.json` and enter +stc server+
