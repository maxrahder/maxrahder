<pre class="runnable 200">
function oops(){
    for (var i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i++){
        setTimeout(function(){
            alert(i);
        }, 10);
    }
}
oops();</pre>

This alerts *3*, three times. There is a single variable *i*, scoped to the function +oops+. 
The loop runs practically instantaneously &mdash; long before the first callback. By then, 
*i* is 3, because the loop has already finished. And the value remains 5 as each timeout is run.

<pre class="runnable 250">
function ahhh() {
    for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        (function(k) {
            setTimeout(function() {
                alert(k);
            }, 10);
        }(i)) // IIFE -- covered in a later topic
    }
}
ahhh();</pre>

This logs *0, 1, 2* because +setTimeout+ is run from the context of a new function which has its own 
copy of *i*, stored in a local variable *k*.
