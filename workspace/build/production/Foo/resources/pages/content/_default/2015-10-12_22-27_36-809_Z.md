#Introduction

In this lab, you'll create the starter universal application.

??Generate the empty starter app

Using a terminal window, navigate to `/ext/` and run this command:

    sencha generate app -starter=false Umbrella ../umbrella

??Get the starter code

Rather than going through the chore of generating the classic and modern main views, 
you'll just start with a boilerplate starter app.

Unzip <a href="resources/umbrella.zip" target="_blank">umbrella.zip</a> and move the `app`, `classic`, 
`modern`, and `resources` folders to `/labs/umbrella`.

??Create the CSS and initialize the microloader

As usual, when generating an empty starter app, the application's CSS and bootstrap don't exist
until you do a development build.

Using a terminal window, navigate to the `/labs/umbrella` folder and run this command:

    sencha app build development

??Run the app

Run the app to make sure everything is set up ok. 

- Run the app as a classic app, and look for *Hello, World!! Classic.*
<br><a href="http://localhost:1841/umbrella/" target="_blank">http://localhost:1841/umbrella/</a>
- Run the app as a modern app, and look for *Hello, World!! Modern.*
<br><a href="http://localhost:1841/umbrella/?modern" target="_blank">http://localhost:1841/umbrella/?modern</a>

Note that from now on &mdash; until you finish the mobile app &mdash; you'll always be running the app as modern.
