In a production build, there is no dynamic loading.

The build process introspects your code
to determine precisely the classes you're using. It then 
creates a single JavaScript file &mdash; that's the file 
used by your users. 

The class definitions are put in the `.js` file, in the order
in which they are required, so that by the time any piece of code
is run, the classes it needs have already been defined.
