<pre>
routes: {
    'foo/:id': 'processRoute'
}
</pre>

This route has a wildcard, specified with the colon. Any value in the URL after
the pattern will be passed to the processing function.

A URL like `http://myapp.com/#foo/123` will result in the controller's
+processRoute+ function being called, passing the value *123*.
