Without adding any code to your application, you can run +sencha app watch --inspect+ to start the Sencha Cmd web server. The additional --inspect flag will automatically inject some code connecting your application to Sencha Inspector.

NOTE: Be sure that Sencha Inspector is already running on your machine at port 1839 before running that command.

Your application will now be viewable in a browser at http://localhost:1841 and Sencha Inspector should automatically detect it and allow you to inspect the application.
