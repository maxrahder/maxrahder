You need the current version of Sencha Cmd.

To get the current version, open a terminal window and type `sencha upgrade`. 
If Cmd is installed, it will start downloading the latest copy. If Sencha Cmd 
is *not* installed, you'll get a *command not found* message. 

If you don't have Cmd, or if your firewall prevents you from running sencha upgrade, you can install Cmd 
by downloading from <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download" target="_blank">http://www.sencha.com/products/sencha-cmd/download</a>.
