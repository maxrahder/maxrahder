At the bottom of each lab look for the section titled *Solution* &mdash; it usually 
includes a video of an instructor working the lab, along with source code and a zip 
of the completed app.

The .zip contains source code you can use to replace the code in your version of the
application. To use it, unzip then replace your copy of `index.html`, `app.json`, and 
the `app/` folder. Then use a terminal window and navigate to your application 
folder and run `sencha generate app development`.
