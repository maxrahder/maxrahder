#Introduction

In this lab, you'll generate the initial app for the project.

??Start the server

If you haven't already done so, make sure the server is running at the `SenchaTraining`
folder.

To start the server, open a terminal window and navigate to the `SenchaTraining` folder. 
Then copy and paste this command:
    
    sencha web start


??Generate the app

Using a terminal window, navigate to `/ext/` and copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha generate app -modern -starter=false ISS ../iss

The +-modern+ parameter means only the modern toolkit is used. 

??Create the main view

Using a terminal window, navigate to `/labs/iss/` and copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha generate view main.Main

Then, edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and change the +extend+
to +Ext.Container+ &mdash; a container is a good generic starting point
for the viewport.

Also give it +xtype:'main'+.

When you are finished, the `Main.js` should look like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly 140">
Ext.define("ISS.view.main.Main",{
    extend: "Ext.Container",
    xtype: 'main',
    html: "Hello, World!!"
});</pre>

??Create `Application.js`

Then, create the file `app/Application.js` with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly 300">
Ext.define('ISS.Application', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.Application',
    name: 'ISS',
    onAppUpdate: function () {
        Ext.Msg.confirm('Application Update', 'This application has an update, reload?',
            function (choice) {
                if (choice === 'yes') {
                    window.location.reload();
                }
            }
        );
    }
});
</pre>

The +onAppUpdate+ method is used by the microloader to let the user know
when the cached application has changed.

If you had created the normal starter code, the main view would have been a tab panel, and `app/Application.js` would already be there. 
Cleaning up the starter code is about the same effort as starting with an empty project and creating your own initial views.

??Initialize the microloader

Using a terminal window, navigate to `/labs/iss/` and copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha app build development

As you may recall, this command processes `app.json` and creates a fresh copy of the microloader bootstrap files, and also creates a CSS file for your app.

??Run the app

Save your changes and visit <a href="localhost:1841/iss" target="lab">localhost:1841/iss</a>.
You should see *Hello World!!* from the main view.
