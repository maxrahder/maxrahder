#Introduction

In this lab, you'll add the map that will soon display the position of the ISS.

??Create the map class

Create the file `app/view/Map.js` with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly 200">
Ext.define('ISS.view.Map', {
    extend: 'Ext.Map',
    //alias: 'widget.issmap',
    xtype: 'issmap',
    useCurrentLocation: true
});
</pre>

Note that the class has the alias *issmap*. When defining a component you have the option
of either using the +alias+ config with the *widget* prefix, or using the convenience syntax
+xtype+.

??Use the map class

Edit `app/view/main/Main.js` and add +requires:['ISS.view.Map']+.

Modify the map tab to use the map's alias, rather than component. You also won't need the +html+ 
property any more. When you are finished, the first item in the +items+ array will look like this:

    {
        xtype: 'issmap',
        title: 'Map',
        iconCls: 'x-fa fa-crosshairs'
    }
    
The +xtype+ specifies the alias of the component you're creating. That alias is defined in +ISS.view.Map+, which
is why you required it &mdash; without requiring (loading) it, the alias wouldn't be known, and you'd get a runtime
error.

Save and refresh and... It won't work, because you haven't loaded the Google Maps library yet!

??Add the Google Maps library

Edit `index.html` and place this +<script>+ tag immediately after the +<title>...</title>+.

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js"></script>

Save and refresh your browser, and you should see the map centered on your location.

??Try some map options

Add this config to the map class file, and refresh the browser:

    mapOptions: {
        zoom: 15
    }

You should see the map zoomed in pretty far.

??Run some Google Map methods

Edit `app/view/Map.js` and completely remove the +useCurrentLocation:true,+. 

From now on you'll
be setting the map's location procedurally, by running +panTo()+. Without explicitly setting the 
center, Google Maps defaults to the *Googleplex*, Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California.

Save your changes, and refresh your browser. 

Then in the Google developer tools console, enter this command:

    var map = Ext.first('issmap').getMap();
    
This puts a reference to the Google Maps object into the variable *map*. Now you can run methods on it.
Try this:

    map.setZoom(3);

The map should zoom out to show an entire continent!

Try this:

    map.setZoom(14);
    var center = {lat:33.6751155,lng:-95.5316914};
    map.panTo(center);

The map should zoom in, and pan to Paris.

Now try this:

    new google.maps.Marker({
        map: map,
        position: center
    });


You should see a map marker centered at Paris.

??Set the zoom to be zoomed out

The space station is visible from a 
wide area, and it moves pretty fast<small><sup>*</sup></small>, so it's good to have the map zoomed out pretty far.

Edit `app/view/Map.js` and set the zoom to 3. 

Your code should look like this when completed

    mapOptions:{
        zoom: 3
    },

<br>
<small><sup>*</sup>
The international space station goes about 27,600 km/h (17,100 mph).
