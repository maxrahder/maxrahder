# Category Data is Often Rotated

For plotting by category, a given data set may need to be rotated. For example, to show
temperature on the *x* axis and month on the *y* axis, the following dataset needs to be rotated:

<pre>
[ { city : "Paris" , January:  6, February: 7, March: 11, April: 14},
  { city : "London", January:  7, February: 7, March:  9, April: 11 } ]
</pre>



<pre>
[ { month : "January" , Paris :  6, London :  7 }, 
  { month : "February", Paris :  7, London :  7 }, 
  { month : "March"   , Paris : 11, London :  9 }, 
  { month : "April"   , Paris : 14, London : 11 } ]
</pre>
