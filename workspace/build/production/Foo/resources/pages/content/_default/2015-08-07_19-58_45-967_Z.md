<p>
You will start with a copy of YelpExtplorer, an application that lets you
search for businesses by city and by category. 
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>The application displays businesses in a map, a grid, and a dataview. 
<li>Details for a selected business are shown in a detail panel. 
<li>Business names and ratings can be edited.
</ul>
</p><p>
This is the same application coded during the *Intermediate Ext JS* training course.
</p>

<p>
In this course, you will add a *modern* user interface to the application. 
</p><p>
It works in much the same way as the *classic* version, but due to the more
limited display space on a mobile device, you will use a view drill-down to show 
details on a business and to show the edit form.
</p><p>
There are a few other differences:
<ul>
<li>Rather than use a shared map class, you'll extend +Ext.Map+
<li>You will use the *modern* +Ext.dataview.List+ rather than the *classic* +Ext.view.View+ 
<li>There is no grid
</ul>
