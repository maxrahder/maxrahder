You can create a code snippet for frequently used CUSTOM code and objects like a function or an items array under: 

    Webstorm > Preferences > Editor > Live Templates
    


**xc + tab** - inserts 

    Ext.create( <class name>, {} ) has already been added as a live template

To add more:
		
- choose the keystroke combination for your particular snippet, and the keystroke that will implement it (ex:tab, enter, space)

- include comments to support and suggest proper implementation of features
