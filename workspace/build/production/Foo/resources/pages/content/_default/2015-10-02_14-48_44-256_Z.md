#Introduction
 
In this lab, you'll create a modern starter application and review its structure. A modern
app is structured as a Touch 2.x app.

#Steps

??Generate the starter application

In a terminal window, go to the `SenchaTraining/ext-6` folder and type this statement:

    sencha generate app -modern MyModern ../labs/mymodern


??Run the application

Now use your Web browser to visit the new application. You'll see the starter app.

??Look at `app/view/main/Main.js`

The main view is a tab panel. As in the classic version, there's a lot of binding and most of the tabs simply show *lorem ipsum* text. The application also
has a grid, and it also creates a store via an alias. 


??Look at `app/Application.js`

This is structured like it is in the classic app, and uses the +onAppUpdate+ method. 

??Look at `app.js`

This is also structured like it is in the classic app, and uses +mainView+.
