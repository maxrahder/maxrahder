The +plugins+ config is introduced at the +Ext.Component+. 
The only requirement for a plugin is that the plugin object have an +init+
method that takes a reference to a component. 

If you specify a plugin (or array of plugins), upon component creation, the component
will call each plugin's +init+ method, passing a reference to itself. 
The plugin is then free to do whatever it wants: it may add DOM content, it may 
react to component events, etc.
