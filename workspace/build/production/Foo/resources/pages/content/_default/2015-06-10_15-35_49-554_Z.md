#Introduction

In this lab, you will try out the most commonly used Google Developer Tools debugger 
features: Sources, Network and Console.

The lab is written assuming you are using Chrome. Other debuggers, such as Firefox's FireBug have 
similar features, but if you are using something other than Chrome, you will have to figure out the 
corresponding feature. Obviously, we haven't covered any Ext JS concepts or syntax yet, so don't 
worry about the details of the code. Instead, focus on the features of the debugger.

#Steps

??Create the sample application
 
The courseware includes the starting application logic for this lab, located in the `debugging/app/` folder. 
 
To put the Ext JS application infrastructure around the code, open a terminal window and navigate to 
the `[web root]/SenchaTraininglabs/ext/` folder. Then generate the application by 
entering:
<pre>sencha generate app --classic Beatles ../debugging</pre>
 
When you generate an application, existing files are *not* replaced. 

??Run the sample application
 
In your web browser, navigate to `labs/debugging`. It's a simple application
with a viewport, a grid, a store and a record definition (model). The 
grid has a toolbar with a button. Click on the button and you'll see an alert.

??Open the Google Developer Tools debugger
 
Open your browser's debugger. For chrome, that's done via the menu option View | Developer | Developer Tools. 
Note the shortcut key for opening the debugger â€” you'll be using the debugger so frequently, the 
shortcut key will come in handy.

??Review the debugger's layout
 
Note that the Chrome debugger has toolbar options for

- *Elements*, used to inspect DOM elements, 
- *Network*, used to see network traffic, 
- *Sources*, for seeing loaded JavaScript files and set breakpoints, and
- *Console*, for entering JavaScript statements.
 
There are other sections: Timeline, Profiles, Resources, and Audits. 
The other sections are used much less often.

??Look at the debugger Sources tab
 
Note that all the JavaScript sources in our application are shown, grouped by path.

??Set a break point
 
In Sources, select `app/view/beatles/Grid.js` and set a break point on the statement 
showing the alert &mdash; it's the statement that reads +Ext.Msg.alert(button.getText(), 'Yeah yeah yeah!');+. 

Breakpoints are set by clicking on the source code line number. Line numbers with breakpoints are highlighted in blue.
 
<img src="resources/images/labs/debugging/SetBreakpoint.png">

Click on the "She loves me..." button, and execution stops on the break point.
 
On the right of Sources is a section titled "Watch Expressions". There's a + button on its toolbar 
that lets you watch (evaluate) expressions when you're in the debugger.
 
<img src="resources/images/labs/debugging/HittingBreakpoint.png">
 
Press \+ and add the watch expression +this.$className+. Any object created using Sencha's class system 
has this property, which holds the name of the current object's class. This is handy to verify what 
class you're in, and the scope of function calls. If you're stopped on the breakpoint you just created 
you should see Ext.button.Button as the value of +this.$className+. That means the function is being run 
in the context of a button.

Press \+ and add another watch expression: +arguments+. Arguments is an object automatically created by 
JavaScript. It holds all the parameters passed to a function. If you click on "She loves me..." again and 
look at the arguments watch expression, you'll see that two parameters were passed to the function. If 
you were to inspect them, you'd find that they are the button that fired the event, and an event object, 
describing things such as the mouse coordinates and whether a special key was pressed.

??Use the debugger console

Note that Chrome has a separate console section, and in addition a small console section can be shown 
anywhere in the debugger via the "Drawer" toolbar button.

Click on the drawer button to show the console drawer in the Sources section. 
Then press "She loves me..." again to hit your break point. If you then go to the console, 
you can run any JavaScript statement you want, scoped at the break point.
 
<img src="resources/images/labs/debugging/Drawer.png">

On the console type +arguments[0].$className;+ and you'll see Ext.button.Button. This works because +arguments+
is a local variable that exists at your breakpoint. 
 
On the console press the up arrow on your keyboard &mdash; Chrome keeps a history of what you've typed, 
accessed via up and down arrow. 

Change the console statement to look at the second argument: +arguments[1].$className;+ and you'll see Ext.event.Event.

Note that you can run *any statement you'd like*. Try entering +button.setText('Hi there!');+ and you'll see 
the button's caption change! The code works because button is the local variable holding the reference to the 
"She loves me..." button. Button objects have a +setText()+ method used to set the caption.
 
In this way, you can run any statement and any method of any object in scope. You can also run methods in your own 
classes. *This is an important concept*. It means you can use the console for a lot more than setting breakpoints. 
You can also use it to test your application's API.
 
The console drawer takes up space, so it's a good habit to close it when you aren't using it.

??Use your IDE to inspect the application

In your IDE look at the `labs/debugging` directory. Note that the file structure is the 
same as what you saw in the Sources section of the debugger.
 
Edit `labs/debugging/app/view/beatles/GridModel.js` and comment out the stores config. 
 
In JavaScript, a double-slash comments out the rest of a line of code, so just put a double 
slash at the start of the statements. 
<pre>
Ext.define('Beatles.view.beatles.GridModel', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.ViewModel',    
    alias: 'viewmodel.beatles-grid',
 
    requires: ['Beatles.model.Person'],
 
    // stores: {
    //     people: {
    //     	model: 'Beatles.model.Person',
    //     	autoLoad: true
    //     }
    // }

});
</pre>
 
Save your change, switch over to your browser and refresh the page. Since we are no longer using a store, the grid is empty.
 
Click on the "She loves you..." button. You'll see the alert, but you do not see your breakpoint! This is because when 
fetching files, the Sencha class loader adds a "no cache" parameter to the URL for the file. That's done to guarantee 
that you get a fresh copy of everything as you make changes to your code. The breakpoint is lost because from the 
perspective of the browser the URL is different, so it must be a different file altogether, and whatever breakpoints
you used for the previous URL are no longer relevant.

??Use the console to get a reference to a component
 
Ext JS has methods for getting reference to components. 

In the browser's debugger console, enter 

    Ext.ComponentQuery.query('beatles-grid');
    
This fetches all components with the xtype +beatles-grid+. There's only one instance, so the array should have
one item. If you wanted to do something with the grid, you could index into the array, then run grid methods or
access properties.

The syntax of +Ext.ComponentQuery+ is a little verbose, so Ext JS version 6 provides a couple of convenience
methods for getting component references:

- +Ext.all(selector, root)+ returns all components matching the selector.
- +Ext.first(selector, root)+ returns the first component matching the selector.

The *root* parameter specifies the container to look in. You rarely use the second parameter
because it defalts to the base container.

In the browser's debugger console, enter this. 

    Ext.first('beatles-grid').$className;
    Ext.first('beatles-grid').getTitle();

You should see *Beatles.view.beatles.Grid* and *Beatles*.

Sometimes it's nice to save the reference in a variable. One advantage is that the debugger
can then provide code-completion (via introspection). Try typing this, but stop typing when you get to 
the dot &mdash; then slowly type *getTitle*. As you type, the debugger will offer to complete the statement.

    var grid = Ext.first('beatles-grid');
    grid.

To *look* at the function, you can enter +grid.getTitle+. A function is a type in JavaScript, and
by default the console runs +toString+ on an object when it shows its value. To *run* the function 
you need to enter +grid.getStore()+

Now try this:

    Ext.first('grid').$className;

That works too! That's because the selector is the type of the component you're looking for. 
The Beatles grid has the type *beatles-grid*, but it subclasses *grid*, so it's also a grid.
It's a component too! But if you're too broad in the selector, you may get the wrong thing.
For example, if you were try this:

    Ext.first('component').$className;

You'd get *some* component. Even though the grid is a component, there are lots of components, 
so this selector matches something we aren't interested in. 

The moral of the story is, be fairly specific in how you select the component.

??Use the console to get a reference to a store
 
Our application is running, but there's no data in the grid. If this were a bug you'd have 
to ask yourself a few questions: Does the store exist? Does it have data? If not, is the 
code actually fetching data from the backend? Maybe the record definition doesn't match
what's being sent from the backend?
 
It's a little tricky to determine whether the store exists. 

To do it, you need get a reference to the view first, then get the view's 
view model, and get the store from that. Or, for data-aware components, just 
run the +getStore()+ method.

In the console, enter 

    Ext.first('beatles-grid').getStore();

It should return null, because in the previous lab step you commented out the store definition.

Edit the grid view model again, and un-comment the store.

    people: {
	    model: 'Beatles.model.Person',
	    autoLoad: true
    }

Save and refresh. Then in the debugger console type 

    Ext.first('beatles-grid').getStore();

Now you should get an object back &mdash; it's a reference to the store.
 
To see how many records are in the store, add one more piece to the statement: 

    Ext.first('beatles-grid').getStore().getCount();
    
This returns 4, since there are four Beatles, and four rows in the grid.

Try to get the store from the view model:

    Ext.first('beatles-grid').getViewModel().getStore('people')

That's a lot to type! This gets the store via the store's name in the view model. 
When debugging it's often necessary to inspect a view model.
    

??Look at network traffic
 
If a store exists, but is empty, it may never have been loaded. Or perhaps there's something 
wrong with the record definition.

To see the data being fetched, go to the debugger's Network section. By default it shows all 
the files being fetched by your application: scripts, CSS files, images and XHR requests. 
Chrome has a "Filter" toolbar button in the Network section that lets you see only a specific 
type of traffic: 

Filter on XHR calls. That will show the AJAX calls used to populate stores. Look for the call to `theBeatles.json`. 
Select it, and to the right you can look at the request, including query data and headers, and the response. For some 
data, "Preview" shows a formatted version of the response. Looking at network responses is a great way to confirm that 
you are fetching the data you expect.

<img src="resources/images/labs/debugging/NetworkTraffic.png">

??See what happens when the store is there, but the URL is wrong
 
Edit `labs/debugging/app/model/Person.js`, and modify the proxy to use a bad 
URL: +url:'XXXresources/data/theBeatles.json'+. Save your change, and refresh your browser.
 
Look at the Network section, and you'll see the server responded with a 404 (not found). You'll 
also see a similar message on the Console, because the AJAX call threw an exception.

On the console use the up arrow to re-enter 

    Ext.first('beatles-grid').getStore();

This returns a reference to the store &mdash; it exists. Now get the store's record count:

    Ext.first('beatles-grid').getStore().getCount()

It returns 0, because the store was created, but failed to retreive data due to the bad URL.

??See what happens if the store isn't loaded or isn't there
 
Use your IDE to open `labs/debugging/app/view/beatles/GridModel.js` and comment out the +autoLoad:true+. 
Commenting this out means the store won't be loaded at all. Save your change, and refresh the browser.

You'll no longer have a 404, because the call to the backend was never made.
    
Calling +Ext.first('beatles-grid').getStore();+ still returns 0, showing that the store exists, but is empty.

??Un-do the bad code

Now edit `labs/debugging/app/model/Person.js` again, and fix the proxy URL. Also, remember to edit
`labs/debugging/app/view/beatles/GridModel.js` and remove the comment from the autoLoad statement. 
Save and refresh, and verify that things work again.
