The `app` folder is for classes shared by the classic and modern views. This will typically
be record definitions in `app/model` and shared controllers and view models in `app/view`.

Code in `classic` can reference classes in `app`, but can *not* referrence code in `modern`.
Similarly, code in `modern` can reference classes in `app`, but can *not* reference code in `classic`.
