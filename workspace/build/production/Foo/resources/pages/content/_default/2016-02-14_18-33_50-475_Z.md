To test a user interface, your tests need to get references to elements and components in order to examine their state and behavior.

But as an application runs, it may take time for components to be created and rendered. Therefore, your testing code needs 
some way to wait before examining a given component.

To handle that situation, Sencha Test's ST API has the concept of a *future* &mdash; a future is a wrapper around a component
or DOM element that defers tests until the item is fully created.
