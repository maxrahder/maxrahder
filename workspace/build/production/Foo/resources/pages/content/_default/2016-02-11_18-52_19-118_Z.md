Jasmine organizes tests in *suites* and *specs* (specifications). Typically, one Sencha Test test file holds a single Jasmine test suite. 
A Jasmine suite is a collection of test specifications. 

<div type="expander" caption="Suites">
Suites are created using the +describe()+ function, which takes two parameters:
<ul>
<li>A string that describes the suite
<li>A function which contains any code you need, including test specifications
</ul>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Test Specifications">
Test specifications are created using the +it()+ function, which takes two parameters:
<ul>
<li>A string that describes the test
<li>A function which contains any code you need, including expectations
</ul>
</div>
