#Introduction

YelpExtplorer follows the shared-controller architecture used by the starter app.
In this lab you'll refactor the architecture to move the controller logic specific
to the classic UI into the classic folder.  

#Steps


??Plan how to make routes specific to the classic view

The way you've coded it, the routes logic is shared by both the classic and modern views. But that
doesn't make sense because the routes logic interacts with view components, and the view is different
in the classic and modern views. (Although right now, there *is no* modern view.)

The technique to handle this is to have the classic and modern views use their own view controllers
and view models, but have those extend the shared view controller and view model. In that way, the
shared copy can hold logic to update view model properties and stores, and the view-specific copy 
can hold logic that references the view.


??Create the classic view controller

Create `classic/view/main/MainController.js` and use this code:

<pre>
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainController', {
    extend: 'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainControllerShared',
    alias: 'controller.main'
});
</pre>

Note that controller extends +YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainControllerShared+. That class doesn't exist yet!

??Change the shared view controller

Rename `app/view/main/MainController.js` to `MainControllerShared.js`. Then edit the file and change 
the class name to +YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainControllerShared+ and remove the alias. The alias no 
longer goes here, because you won't be creating an instance of the shared controller directly &mdash; 
instead, you'll create the controller in `classic`, which is why the alias is there.

After saving your changes, use a terminal window and in the `SenchaTraining/labs/yelpextplorer` enter

    sencha app refresh

The refresh is needed because the controller named +MainController+ used to be in `classic` but now
it's in `app` &mdash; Cmd can get confused about where things are, and +sencha app refresh+ helps it
figure things out.

If you save and refresh, everything should work the same as before, but you can confirm that the new 
controller is being used by looking at the Sources tab in Chrome Developer Tools &mdash; you should
see both `classic/src/view/main/MainController.js` and `app/view/main/MainController.js` being loaded.

??Move the routes mixin

Move `Routes/js` from `app/view/main` to `classic/view/main`. Then edit `app/view/main/MainControllerShared.js`
and copy and paste the +mixins+ and +routes+ configs to `classic/view/main/MainController.js`.

Do another +sencha app refresh+, then run the app. Like before, it will behave the same, but if you look
in the Sources tab in Developer Tools you should see `Routes.js` being loaded from the new location.
