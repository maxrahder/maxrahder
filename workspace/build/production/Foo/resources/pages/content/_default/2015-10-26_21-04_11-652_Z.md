#Introduction

In this lab, you'll install webstorm and customize it a bit.

The following installation assumes the Webstorm IDE

?? Initial screen will take you here

This is similar to the first screen you will see. I've selected all the defaults and will make some changes when opening the editor.

?? We'll choose configure to enter the IDE

This is how you would enter the IDE the first time. Choose Configure > Plugins.

If you have already used the IDE you can choose Preferences from inside the editor.

?? Adding the Sencha Plugin

In the Preferences panel, navigate to Plugins and type Sencha in the search field. Click Browse and install the Webstorm plugin. 
When the Install button changes to Restart Webstorm, select it and restart the IDE.

?? We'll customize the IDE just a bit

Select Configure > Preferences > Editor. You could spend all of your free time for the next several years customizing from here but 
I'll start by making some edits to make it easier for you to read the instructor machine.

I'm starting with the Default Scheme. I will use a light background to make it easier for you to read and enlarge the fonts and spacing. 
Before I can make any changes, I must save this with a new name. It won't matter which name you choose because your new name will default 
to the bottom of the list. I chose "Sencha". Once you have given the scheme a new name, you can change the font settings for the editor. 
I chose:
* Primary font - **Consolas**
* Size - **20** 
* Line spacing - **1.1**. 
 
You'll be able to see the changes in the preview window.

On your machine, feel free to make a 
different selection and starting point for your customizing of the editor.
