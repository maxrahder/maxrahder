The two most uncool JavaScript constructs are +eval()+ and +with+. Don't use them.

The +eval()+ function will compile and run the JavaScript string. There are many
reasons +eval()+ is *verboten*, including the fact that it defeats compiler
optimization.
<pre class="runnable 140">
function doIt(s){
    eval(s);
}
doIt("alert('yo!');");
</pre>

+with()+ is designed to be a way to simplify code, but it has some unexpected scoping.
<pre class="runnable 200">
var o = {a: 1, b: 2};
with (o){
    a = 17;
    b = 34;
    c = 55;
}
alert(o.a + ', ' + o.b + ', ' + o.c); // Alerts 17, 34, undefined
</pre>
