A modern app now uses the same data package and other core packages as Ext JS. That means
you will have to refactor model definitions, since in the shared package, models do not
nest configs in a `config` block. 

Modern apps can also use view models, view controllers and binding. It's not required, but
you can take advantage of those features if desired.
