#Introduction

In this lab, you will create a Survey form to get input from the users of your app.

??Create the Survey model

Drag a +Model+ from the Toolbox to +Models+ in the Project Inspector. Update the Model and set the *userClassName* to +Survey+.
  
The model should hold the following fields. 

    firstName,lastName,emailAddress,useExtJS,useSenchaTouch,useGXT,
    startedUsingSencha,websiteUrl

??Update the Survey model
  
The Survey +idProperty+ will change from +id+ to +_id+.

The following fields also need to be updated.

Select the field on the right and type type in the Config Panel filter. The types for the field
are available to select from the drop down arrow on the right. 

TIP: Since we are changing the type for all of them, you can select the lock to the right of the filter to keep that config selected.
Once you no longer need the type, you can unlock to allow you to select any other config.
  

    useExtJS,useSenchaTouch,useGXT // boolean types
    startedUsingSencha // date type with dateFormat: U (UNIX epoch)

Your code will now look like the following:

??Add a REST proxy to the model  

The URL for the survey API is <a href="http://traininglabs.sencha.com/api/survey/touch/" target="lab">Survey API.</a>You will use a REST proxy for this model to
support GET/POST/PUT/DELETE HTTP methods.
  
Drag a Rest Proxy from the Toolbox to the Survey model in the Project Inspector and update the proxy URL to use the survey API URL above.

Drag a Json Reader from the Toolbox to +MyRestProxy+ in the Survey model. Update the MyJsonReader +rootProperty+ to look
at the return +data+ object.

??Create a controller for the Survey form

The Survey controller will be responsible for managing the Survey view, validating the form, and saving data to the server using the new model.

From the Toolbox, drag a Controller to the Controllers in the Project Inspector. Set the *userClassName* to Survey.

??Modify the Survey controller

Update the Survey controller to require the Survey model. Click on the Survey controller and find the models property. 
From the drop down select the Survey model and confirm to **Remove** the Survey model from the main application.
  
??Create a reference for the Survey form

Under the Survey controller, find the References property and choose to add a new Reference. The name for this reference is +surveyForm+ and the
selector is +survey formpanel+. 
  
Save and refresh the app to make sure there no errors on the developer Console.


??Add a form to the Survey view

Since you are now going to have content in this area, the first thing you can do is remove the 
html placeholder text.

Select the Survey view from the Project Inspector and set the layout to +fit+.

Drag a Form Panel from the Toolbox to the Survey view in the Project Inspector.

Add the following fields

2 text Fields, Email Field, Date Picker Field, Field Set, URL Field and a button

Select the Field Set. Remove the two automatically added fields and add three toggle fields to the Field Set
  
Now add the following form field attributes:

TIP: You might find it quickest to set all the labels, names etc. by locking the filter on the Config Panel and then selecting the fields.

|  |    |    |
|:-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Text Field**
| label: First Name  | name : firstName  | placeholder: John   
| required: checked
| **Text Field**
| label: Last Name     | name : lastName               |placeholder: Doe
| **Email Field**
| label: E-mail Address     | name : emailAddress  |placeholder: email@example.com (This is the default)
| **Date Picker Field**
| label: When did you start using Sencha Products?  | name : startedUsingSencha     |labelAlign: top
| **Field Set**| 
| label: Sencha Products Used
| **Field Set SubFields - All Toggle Fields**
| label: Ext JS  | name : useExtJS       |
| label: SenchaTouch  | name : useTouch     |
| label: GXT  | name : useGXT       |
| **URL Field**
| label: Website?   | name : websiteURL     |
| **Button**
| text: Submit  | ui: action       |itemID: submitButton
    
Save and refresh the application. You should see the form with the appropriate fields display for our Survey.

Run the following in the Console:

    YelpTouch.app.getController('Survey').getSurveyForm()


![](resources/images/_yelptouch/t_yelp13.png "border")  
  
??Submit the form

We need to listen for the +tap+ event on the Submit button. In the Project Inspector select the Submit button
in the Survey form. Choose Event Binding from the Properties and select to add a new Basic Event Binding for 
the +tap+ event.
  
This will create a new function +onSubmitButtonTap+. Test that the tap event listener is working by logging
to the console.
  

    console.log('onSubmitButtonTap');

Save and refresh the application. Select the Survey and form and click on the Submit button. You should see the message logged to the console.
  
Ultimately, we want the Survey controller to be responsible for the form submission. Select the +onSubmitbuttonTap+
event from the Project Inspector. Right-click on the event and choose Convert to Controller Action and select the Survey controller.
The event should now be migrated to the Survey controller. 
  
Save the project and test the Survey Submit button again. You should still see the log in the console.
  
Coding the logic for the form at this point is straightforward. You need to get the values from the form,
create a new record with the survey data, and save the model to the server.
  
??Get the values from the form
 
Since you created a reference, you can access the form using +this.getSurveyForm()+. The form panel has a +getValues()+ method which returns an object 
consisting of all the form field name/value pairs.
    
Let's go ahead and drop this into the +onSubmitButtonTap+ method and assign the return value to a variable. 
We will add a console.log to test the result:
    
    var formValues = this.getSurveyForm().getValues();
    console.log(formValues);
    
??Create a new model with the survey data
 
Creating a model with an existing data object is really easy. If you remember from the data package, 
you can pass in an object of the model field/values pairs. 

You already have that now in +formValues+. Replace the console log from the previous step with this code.

    var surveyRecord = Ext.create('YelpTouch.model.Survey', formValues);

Way-to-go!
    
??Save the model to the server 
 
All you have to do is call the +Ext.data.Model.save()+ method to use the REST proxy. 
This will POST the survey data to the server. However, you may want your submission to be a little more robust.
    
The +save()+ method will take an additional callback function that returns the updated record (on success) and operation. This is useful to make sure you got a 
success response from our server and to handle server responses and error codes gracefully. The following code should be placed
after the code on the onSubmitButtonTap that you have peviously altered.
    

    surveyRecord.save(function(record, operation) {
        if (operation.success) {
            Ext.Msg.alert('Survey saved.', 'Thanks for your entry!');
        } else {
           Ext.Msg.alert('Oops! Something went wrong!', 'Maybe you should look into it.');
      }
    });     
    
This is good. Now you can show the user that the operation was successful or that an error occured when you submitted data to the server, but you can go one step further. The +operation+ parameter has a +.getReponse()+ method which returns the standard XmlHttpRequest response object. From here, you can use +Ext.decode+ to convert the +responseText+ into a JSON structure.
    
The traininglabs.sencha.com Survey API was programmed to return +success: true+ if a record has been created or +success: false, msg: <reason>+ if the create failed. 

Here is the final +onSubmitButtonTap+ method for the Survey controller.

    onSubmitButtonTap: function(button, e, eOpts) {
       var formValues = this.getSurveyForm().getValues();
       var surveyRecord = Ext.create('YelpTouch.model.Survey', formValues);
       surveyRecord.save(function(record, operation) {
          if (operation.success) {
              Ext.Msg.alert('Survey saved.', 'Thanks for your entry!');
          } else {
              Ext.Msg.alert('Oops! Something went wrong!', 'Maybe we should look into it.');
          }
     });
    }

 
Save and test your form! Take a look into the network tab to see the messages you are posting.
Try again to submit the same message. Did you see an error message?

??Challenge

You can optimize this form with client-side validation. In Sencha Touch, you can solve this via the Model.
Browse back through the data package slides, and see if you can build it in!

#Conclusion

You just added a form to the page to do a survey. Now you can receive input from the user of your application.
