By the way, in the lab you're about to do, you'll see another error type: global variables.

When a test launches, Sencha Test looks at the global object's properties. At the end 
of the test, it looks again &mdash; new properties are flagged as errors.
App code should never define a variable without the *var* keyword.

<pre class="runnable 120 readonly">
var i; // A local variable

i.o = 2; // o becomes a property of i

o = 3; // o becomes a property of the global object -- your code should never do this</pre>

However, some libraries you use *may* define globals. For example, Google Maps will add the
*google* namespace, as well as a few other odd properties, such as *\_xdc\_*. 

If your test
fails because of a global variable that isn't in your code, you can allow them for the test
project as a whole, or for specific scenarios.
