#Introduction

In this lab, you'll see the architecture of the entire app in one convenient location.

This tab shows all currently loaded classes organized in the same way as the file structure.
The App Architecture tab gives you a single location to verify all classes expected to be 
available are loaded at any given time. You may explore the application architecture by manually 
expanding the tree, or by filtering the list.
