#Introduction

In this lab you'll set up a local browser farm and run the application test 
scenario against it. 

#Steps

??Configure the archive server

Create the folder `SenchaTest/workspace/ArchiveServer`, and in it create a file
named `storage.json` with this JSON:


<pre class="runnable readonly json 200">
{
    "DeveloperTestResults": {
        "path": "/developers"
    },
    "QATestResults": {
        "path": "/qa"
    }
}</pre>

These paths determine the location of the archive folder.

??Start the archive server

Using a terminal window,  navigate to `SenchaTest/workspace/ArchiveServer`, and enter:

    stc server

This starts the archive server. You should see something like this on the console:

    Sencha Test v2.0.0
    Archive server listening on port 1903


??Run the a test from the command line

Open a new terminal window and navigate to `SenchaTest/workspace/ArchiveServer`, then enter the following 
(note that the command is long, so make sure you've copied the entire statement).
    
    stc run -s ../HitchhikersGuide/test/application -p MyBrowserPool -o text -S http://localhost:1903 -K DeveloperTestResults

You're running the application scenario and using the browser pool that you set up previously. Note that the *-S* parameter matches the port for 
the archive server, and *-K* matches a key in `storage.json`.

After a while, you should briefly see a Chrome window launched, and the tests running in it, after which the browser window closes. In the terminal window you 
should see console statements about test launching and results. 

After the tests have run, if you look in the file system, inside the `SenchaTest/workspace/ArchiveServer` directory you'll see a new folder
 &mdash; named `storage/developers` &mdash; that holds the test archive. 


??Configure Studio to display the STC test archive

In Studio, select the +Runs+ tab in the navigation panel, then choose the *configure* toolbar button and set
+Archive Server+ to *http://localhost:1903* and +Archive Root Folder+ to  */developers*.

The +Archive Server+ entry corresponds to where the server is running, as you saw in the *Start the archive server*
lab step. The +Archive Root Folder+ entry corresponds to the `storage.json` key you used when you ran the scenario
with `stc` in the previous step.

??View the results

Now choose the disc icon on the navigation panel and drill down to see the test results on the right.
