#Introduction

In this lab, you'll connect to the demo app to see all the information available in the Inspector. 

Follow these steps:

A DemoClient app has been provided for you to learn how to benefit from the Inspector and familiarize 
yourself with Sencha Inspector’s features. 


NOTE: The demo app is pre-configured for connecting with Sencha Inspector 
(using the default settings: http://local.senchainspector.com:1839).

?? Open Sencha Inspector

The home screen will be empty. This indicates that no apps can currently be inspected.

?? Connecting to the Demo App

To inspect the demo app, click the “Connect your app…” button in the top toolbar. Next, click “Open demo app” to open the demo application in your default browser. 

If you’d like to open it in another browser, simply open the following url in the browser of your choice. (http://examples.sencha.com/sencha-inspector/feed-viewer/)

The demo application will prompt you to connect to Sencha Inspector – be sure the port number in the popup matches the port on which Sencha Inspector is running on your local machine (you can verify this under “Settings” (the gear on the toolbar)).
