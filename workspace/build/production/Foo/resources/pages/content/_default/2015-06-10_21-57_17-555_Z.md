This course could simply go over component syntax, and we will.

But what makes Ext JS more than a component library
are its architectural features:
- The class system
- Dynamic loading
- Separation of concerns
- The relationship between views, view models and view controllers
- The build process

So we'll try to strike a balance: How to use components and how to 
put them together into complex applications.
