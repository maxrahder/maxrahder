The proxy is *how* and *where* to get the data. 

In this case, the *how* is Ajax, and the *where* is the `api.is` data feed.

    proxy: {
        type: 'ajax',
        url: '//apis.is/earthquake/is',
        reader: {
            rootProperty: 'results'
        }
    }

The proxy also has a +reader+ config, which is needed because the data feed
nests the data in a property called *results*.
