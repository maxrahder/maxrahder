#Introduction

In this lab, you'll change the main view to a carousel, then create view classes for the images and form. 

Initially, the view classes will be stubbed out and just show a value via +html+. In later labs, you'll 
fully implement the views.

??Make the main view a carousel

Edit `modern/src/view/main/Main.js`:

- Delete the +html+ property
- Have it +extend:'Ext.carousel.Carousel'+
- Add an +items+ array with two items
    - The first item is +xtype:'container'+ and +html:'umbrella images'+
    - The second item is +xtype:'container'+ and +html:'form'+

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define("Umbrella.view.main.Main", {
    extend: "Ext.carousel.Carousel",
    xtype: 'main',
    requires: [
        "Umbrella.view.main.MainController",
        "Umbrella.view.main.MainModel",
        'Ext.MessageBox'
    ],

    controller: "main-main",
    viewModel: {
        type: "main-main"
    },

    items: [{
        xtype: 'container',
        html: 'umbrella images'
    }, {
        xtype: 'container',
        html: 'form'
    }]
});
</pre>

Save and refresh, and you should see the *umbrella images* text, and you can swipe back and forth between it and *form*.

??Create the images view class

Create the file `modern/src/view/Umbrella.js`.

You've created enough view classes by now that you can do this in your sleep. Initially, just 
have it +extend:'Ext.Container'+, give it +xtype:'umbrella'+ and set +html:'umbrella container'+

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('Umbrella.view.Umbrella', {
    extend: 'Ext.Container',
    xtype: 'umbrella',

    html: 'umbrella container'
});
</pre>

??Use the images view class

You just created the stubbed out images view class, but you aren't using it in the main view yet.

Edit `modern/src/view/main/Main.js`.

As always, you can't use a class without loading it, so add a +requires+ entry for +Umbrella.view.Umbrella+.

Then, change the item that shows the images container &mdash; have it use +xtype:'umbrella'+ and remove the item's +html+ config. 

Save and refresh and you should see the *umbrella container* html property used in the umbrella view class.

??Create and use the form view class

Create the file `modern/src/view/Location.js` and define it as a container with xtype *location*. Set the +html+ to some string.

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('Umbrella.view.Location', {
    extend: 'Ext.Container',
    xtype: 'location',

    html: 'location form'
});
</pre>

Then, use it in the main view just like you did for +Umbrella.view.Umbrella+.

The completed main view should look like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define("Umbrella.view.main.Main", {
    extend: "Ext.carousel.Carousel",
    xtype: 'main',
    requires: [
        "Umbrella.view.main.MainController",
        "Umbrella.view.main.MainModel",
        'Ext.MessageBox',
        'Umbrella.view.Umbrella',
        'Umbrella.view.Location'
    ],

    controller: "main-main",
    viewModel: {
        type: "main-main"
    },

    items: [{
        xtype: 'umbrella'
    }, {
        xtype: 'location'
    }]
});
</pre>

Save and refresh, and verify that you see your new class as the second item in the carousel.
