+Ext.Base+ is the base class. But it's a little *too* primitive for some of 
the examples in the topic, so from now on we will be extending +Ext.Component+ or some
other class. 

This is realistic, because in an application you'll always be sub-classing
some class from the library, like some kind of component, a record class,
observable, etc.
