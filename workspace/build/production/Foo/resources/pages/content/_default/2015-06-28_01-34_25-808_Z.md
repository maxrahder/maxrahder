Floating components can overlap one another. +Ext.ZIndexManager+ helps 
manage this behavior.

Windows within floating containers are managed by the 
container's +Ext.ZIndexManager+.

Windows not within other floating components are managed 
by +Ext.WindowManager+, a singleton instance of +Ext.ZIndexManager+.
