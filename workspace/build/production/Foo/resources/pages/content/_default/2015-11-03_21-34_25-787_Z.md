An immediately-invoked function expression (IIFE) &mdash; pronounced *iffy* &mdash; 
is a function that you define and invoke immediately.
The IIFE provides a way to run code that hides its information, isolated
from global scope.

<pre class="runnable 140">
(function iffe (){
    var thisVarIsHiddenToTheOutsideWorld;
    console.log('iffe');
}()); 
</pre>

The outer parantheses prevent the +function+ being parsed as a declaration. The trailing +()+
runs the function.
