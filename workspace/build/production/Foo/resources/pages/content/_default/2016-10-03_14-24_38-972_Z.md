Context and scope are two different, unrelated, concepts.
<pre class="runnable">
function foo(){
    alert('foo(): ' +  (this === window)); 
    function person(name){
        alert('person(): ' +  (this === window)); 
        this.name = name;
    }
    // person is scoped to foo, but here it's called in the context of window -- 
    // this form of a function call is always in the global context.
    person('Ralph');
}
foo();

var o = {fn: foo};
o.fn();

console.log(window.name); // Logs 'Ralph'
</pre>
