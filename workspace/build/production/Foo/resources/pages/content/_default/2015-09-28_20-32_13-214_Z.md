#Introduction

In this lab, you'll contrast how the application runs at development-time,
versus how it runs when you do a production build.

#Steps

??Look at network traffic

If you open the debugger, refresh the page, and look at network traffic you'll see that 33 JavaScript
files were loaded, including `Main.js` and `Grid.js`. This illustrates how the
+requires:[]+ and +extend+ configs result in the corresponding classes being loaded.

??Do a production build

Using a terminal window, navigate to `/labs/earthquakes/` and copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha app build production

This results in a *production* build, placed in `SenchaTraining/labs/earthquakes/build/production/Earthquakes`.

Look at that folder and note the key files that were created:

- An `index.html` which contains an embedded copy of the microloader
- An `app.js` file, which contains the classes and code used by your app
- A `resources/Earthquakes-all.css` file, which is the app CSS file 

There are also a few other files, such as `cache.appcache` which is the application cache
manifest used by the microloader. Also take a peek at one of the images folders, such as
`resources/images/panel` &mdash;
it contains some sprite images needed by older browsers. These sprites are dynamically 
generated during the build.

??Run the production build

In your web browser, run the app via <a href="http://localhost:1841/labs/earthquakes/build/production/Earthquakes/" target="lab">http://localhost:1841/labs/earthquakes/build/production/Earthquakes/</a>.

Look at network traffic and note that there's a *single* JavaScript file being loaded. And if you do a reload, the browser reports a 304, which
means it's using its cached copy. You can also configure the build to use true application caching, in which case you won't even see the 304.

??Do a *development* build

The point of a production build is that the JavaScript and stylesheet are *optimized* &mdash; they only use the Ext JS classes and styles
actually used in the application. 

But during development you are frequently adding and removing various components as you work on the application. That means you need to 
include *all* styling at development time. That's the purpose of a development build. It links your project's stylesheet to all component
styling, and doesn't create a JavaScript file at all, because at development time the code is fetched by the class loader.
As a developer, you rarely run a production build. But if you do, remember to do a development build before you go back to coding.

Using a terminal window, navigate to `/labs/earthquakes/` and copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha app build development

??Go back to running the development app

We're going to keep coding the app, so in your web browser, go back to running the app via its development-time location: 
<a href="http://localhost:1841/labs/earthquakes/" target="lab">http://localhost:1841/labs/earthquakes/</a>.
