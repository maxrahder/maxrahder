#Introduction

Soon, you will code the dataview in the modern view. But you can't do that yet, because the store is coded
in classic &mdash; code in `classic` can't reference code in `modern`, and vice versa. 

In this lab you will move the *{tunes}* store from the classic view controller to a shared view controller.
You'll still have a view-specific controller and view model, because you may need to have view-specific 
control logic or view model properties. The view-specific controllers and view models will extend the
shared classes.

??Try to access the store from both the classic and modern views

Run the app as a classic (desktop) app and use the debugger command line to get a reference to the store:

    Ext.first('main').getViewModel().getStore('tunes');

It returns an object &mdash; the store.

Now run the app as a modern app, by adding the `?modern` query field to the url: <a href="localhost:1841/tunes/?modern" target="_blank">localhost:1841/tunes/?modern</a>.

Try to access the store by means of the same debugger code.

??Create a shared view controller base class

Copy and paste the classic controller to a new folder named `app/view/main/`.

Rename the file `BaseController.js`, and change the class definition to match. 

Then remove the +alias+. When you are finished it will look like this:

    Ext.define('Tunes.view.main.BaseController', {
        extend: 'Ext.app.ViewController'
    });


??Have the views use the new controller base class

In the classic folder, edit `classic/src/view/main/MainController.js` and have it extend +Tunes.view.main.BaseController+:

    Ext.define('Tunes.view.main.MainController', {
        extend: 'Tunes.view.main.BaseController',
        alias: 'controller.main-main'
    });

Do exactly the same for the controller in the modern folder &mdash; edit `modern/src/view/main/MainController.js` and
have it extend +Tunes.view.main.BaseController+. When you are finished, it will look exactly like the classic version.

If you save and refresh, you'll get an error.

That's because the microloader has an especially hard time resolving class references in a univeral app, 
because a class could be in either the toolkit folder or in the shared `app` folder. 

To refresh the microloader, use a terminal window and navigate to the `/labs/tunes` folder and enter this command:

    sencha app refresh

When it's finished running, refresh the browser and you won't have an error. If you look at the Sources tab you can see the
base class being loaded.

??Create a shared view model

Copy and paste the classic view model to `app/view/main/`.

Rename the file `BaseModel.js`, and change the class definition to match. 

Then remove the +alias+. When you are finished it will look like this:

    Ext.define('Tunes.view.main.BaseModel', {
        extend: 'Ext.app.ViewModel',
        requires: ['Tunes.model.Tune'],
        stores: {
            tunes: {
                model: 'Tunes.model.Tune',
                autoLoad: true
            }
        }
    });

Then edit the classic view model and change the code to extend the base class. And now
that the store is in +BaseModel+, it no longer belongs in the classic view model. When 
you are finished, `classic/src/view/main/MainModel.js` should look like this:

    Ext.define('Tunes.view.main.MainModel', {
        extend: 'Tunes.view.main.BaseModel',
        alias: 'viewmodel.main-main'
    });

Edit `modern/src/view/main/MainModel.js` and modify it in exactly the same way &mdash;
it should look identical to the one in classic.


??Move the record class

Generally speaking, the shared `app` folder is for shared code, and never references classes in
either toolkit. In other words, it shouldn't contain or extend any view class, and it shouldn't 
reference any class defined in `classic` or `modern`.

But right now, the classic folder holds the record definition, even though it's used in the
store in the shared +Tunes.view.main.BaseModel+ class. So you have to move it.

Move `classic/src/model/Tune.js` to `app/model/Tune.js`. Delete the `classic/src/model/` folder.

Save your changes, and using a terminal window, navigate to `/labs/tunes` and do a 

    sencha app refresh
    
??Review

Sheesh, there was a lot of copying and pasting in this lab!

Here's what everything should look like:

    app/
        model/
            Tune.js
        view/
            main/
                BaseController.js
                BaseModel.js
        Application.js
    classic/
        sass/
        src/
            view/
                main/
                    Main.js
                    MainController.js
                    MainModel.js
                View.js
    ext/
    modern/
        src/
            view/
                main/
                    Main.js
                    MainController.js
                    MainModel.js

The classic and modern controllers should be identical. And their view models are identical too.


??Verify that the modern view can see the store.

If all your changes are saved, and you've done a +sencha app refresh+, you can try it out.

Refresh the browser, and run the app as a modern app by adding the `?modern` query field to the url: <a href="localhost:1841/tunes/?modern" target="_blank">localhost:1841/tunes/?modern</a>.

Then on the debugger command line enter

    Ext.first('main').getViewModel().getStore('tunes');

This should return a reference to the store! *Huzzah!*
