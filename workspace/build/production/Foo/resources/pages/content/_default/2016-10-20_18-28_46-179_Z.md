The +Ext.ux.ajax.SimManager+ class does something similar &mdash; it provides a way to 
serve hard-coded data for the URLs used by your proxies. +SimManager+ is a way to provide
data, so it wouldn't work as a way to mock up a 404 response, as you saw on the previous 
two slides.

<pre class="runnable 330 readonly">
Ext.ux.ajax.SimManager.register({

    // name:value pairs, where the name is the URL being intercepted and
    // the value is a simlet config, which defined the data being returned

    "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/006/": {
        type: 'json', 
        // The data -- it is a hard-coded version of what's returned
        data: {
            name: 'mock charizard',
            weight: 1
        }
    }

});</pre>

We'll talk more about +Ext.ux.ajax.SimManager+ later.
