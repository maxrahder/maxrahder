Another way to run initial JavaScript is to create additional build profies in `app.json`. 

The profile might be named something like *testusingmockdata*, and would require the
ux package, and would also include a +"js":[]+ entry that holds the code that
sets up the simlets.

+"js":[]+ entries are processed after the Ext JS library is loaded, but before the 
application is run. Thus, simlets created there will be in effect before the 
application starts up.
