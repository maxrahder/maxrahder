When a computer and a mobile device are connected to the same WIFI network (and are on the same subnet), the mobile device may access the remote computerâ€™s localhost via its machine name or IP address:

- +http://{remote_machine_name_here}:1839/ (e.g. http://artmac:1839/)+
- +http://{remote_machine_ip_here}:1839/ (e.g. http://192.168.14.10:1839/)+
