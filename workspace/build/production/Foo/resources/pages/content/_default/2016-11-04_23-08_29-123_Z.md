You need a copy of Ext JS 6.2. The library is distributed as a zip file named something like `ext-6.2.zip`

If you don't already have the Ext JS 6.2 library, you can download the trial version. It's
distributed as a zip with the framework library and a couple of other things.

Copy the library zip to the `SenchaTraining` folder, extract it, and rename the folder `ext-6`. You'll no longer need
the zip.

Also within the `SenchaTraining` folder, add a folder named `labs`.

When you are finished, you should have this folder structure:

    SenchaTraining/
        ext-6/
        labs/
