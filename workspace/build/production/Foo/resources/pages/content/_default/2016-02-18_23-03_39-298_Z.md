<div type="expander" caption="Use Sencha Cmd to generate the app">
Create a project of the same name by using a terminal window to navigate to your Ext JS library folder. Then, depending on whether 
the application is *classic*, *modern* or *universal*, you would type either:
<pre>
sencha generate app -classic -start=false MyApp ../path/to/myapp
sencha generate app -modern -start=false MyApp ../path/to/myapp
sencha generate app -start=false MyApp ../path/to/myapp
</pre>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Copy and replace from the other app to your new app">
In the previous step you created a new project without code. Now you need to copy these
source files and folders from the project you are copying *from*, and paste into the new 
project folder, *replacing* what might already be there.
<ul>
<li>`index.html`, if the other application has application-specific elements in the `<head>`
<li>The `app.json` file, because there may be setting for path, theme, etc.
<li>The `app` folder
<li>The `resources` folder, if there is one
<li>The `sass` folder
<li>The `classic` and `modern` folders, if it's a universal app
</ul>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Rebuild the app">
In order to re-create the `bootstrap.js` microloader and create app CSS files, use a terminal 
window and navigate to the project folder and type
<pre>sencha app build development</pre>
</div>
