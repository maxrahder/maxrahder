#Introduction

In this lab, you'll make the app responsive by testing the width of the window, then 
moving the detail panel to the south when the browser window is tall, or to the east when the 
window is wide.

#Steps

??Review the requirements

The application looks good, unless the user resizes the window and makes it narrow. And some
users will be using a tablet and view the application in either portrait- or lanscape-mode.

In this lab you'll use responsive design to position the detail panel to the south or east,
depending on the orientation of the browser window.


??Make the detail panel responsive

The east detail panel is created in the main view. To make it responsive, you could modify the
+Detail+ class to use the +Ext.mixin.Responsive+ mixin, or you could modify the main panel's 
config to use the mixin plugin. Here, you'll use the plugin.

Edit the main view, and modify the detail east panel's config as follows:

    {
        region: 'east',
        xtype: 'businessdetail',
        plugins: ['responsive'],
        responsiveConfig: {
            wide: {
                region: 'east'
            },
             tall: {
                region: 'south'
            }
        },
        width: 130,
        bind: {
            data: {
                bindTo: '{business}',
                deep: true
            }
        }
    }

Save and refresh your browser window. Then resize it and you should see the detail panel move from east to south, and back, as you resize the window.

??Make it more responsive

Hmmm. When the detail panel is at the south, it looks a little cramped, because the template is 
set up as one column of data. It would be better if we could lay it out as one column when it's at the east, but 
two columns when it's at the south.

To do this, we need to modify the template to use a one- or two- column table. Replace the template with 
this (ugly) code:


    tpl: [
        '<tpl if="this.isData(values)">',
        '<div><table><tr><td>',
        '<b>{name}</b><br/>',
        '{[Ext.Array.map(values.categories, function(item){return item[0];}).join("<br/>")]}<br/><br/>',
        '<img src="resources/images/stars_{rating}.png" /><br/>',
        '<tpl if="this.isPortrait()"></td><td></tpl>',
        '<img src="{image_url}" style="margin: 8px 4px 0 4px;" /><br/><br/>',
        '<tpl if="this.isPortrait()"></td><td></tpl>',
        'Reviews: {review_count}<br/><br/>',
        '{[values.location.display_address.join("<br/>")]}<br/><br/>',
        '<a href="{url}" target="_blank">Review at Yelp</a>',
        '</td></tr></table></div>',
        '</tpl>', {
            isData: function (data) {
                return !Ext.Object.isEmpty(data);
            },
            isPortrait: function () {
                return (Ext.dom.Element.getOrientation() === 'portrait');
            }
        }
    ]


Note that the second column is only used if the browser window is in portrait mode.


??Have the responsive test run your class method
 
The problem with what we have is that the template is bound to the 
business changing, and in this case the business is *not* changing &mdash; whether the detail panel 
is at the east or south, the business being viewed is the same business. So we need to add code that
re-renders the template by running +setData()+ again.

Add this method to the east panel:
<pre>
setRegion: function(region) {
	this.callParent(arguments);
	this.setData(this.getData());
}
</pre>

This is run because the responsive config is setting the *region* property. In other words, it's
running +setRegion()+. The new method is overriding the method, running +this.callParent(arguments)+
to allow the original code to run, then it runs +this.setData(this.getData());+ to re-run the template.

Save your changes, refresh the browser window, then change the window size. You should see two columns, 
or one, depending on the orientation.

??Make the tab panel responsive

Just for fun, let's make the tab panel responsive too. When the window is tall, we'll put
the tabs on the left and rotate the text. When the window is wide, we'll put the tabs on top. 

Since the tab panel is a top-level class, you can use the +mixins:['Ext.mixin.Responsive']+ rather than the
plugin. 

Now add a +responsiveConfig+. Have it set +tabPosition+ to *top* when the window is wide, or *left* when
the window is tall. Set +tabRotation+ to *0* (horizontal) when the window is wide, or *2* (counter-clockwise) 
when the window is tall. 

Save and refresh your browser. Now *that* is *cool*.

#Conclusion

You made the layout responsive to tall (portrait) and wide (landscape). Congratulations!
