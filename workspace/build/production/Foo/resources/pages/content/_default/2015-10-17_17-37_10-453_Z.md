#Introduction

In this lab, you'll create a starter classic application.

??Generate the empty starter app

Using a terminal window, navigate to `/ext/` and run this command:

    sencha generate app -starter=false -classic PivotGrid ../pivotgrid


??Get the starter code

Rather than going through the chore of generating the classic and modern main views, 
you'll just start with a boilerplate starter app.

Unzip <a href="resources/labs/pivotgrid.zip" target="_blank">pivotgrid.zip</a> and move the `app`, and `resources` folders to `/pivotgrid`.

??Create the CSS and initialize the microloader

As usual, when generating an empty starter app, the application's CSS and bootstrap don't exist
until you do a development build.

Using a terminal window, navigate to the `/labs/pivotgrid` folder and run this command:

    sencha app build development

??Run the app

Run the app to make sure everything is ok. 

- Run the app as a classic app, and look for *Sales Pivot Grid* title above an empty panel.

NOTE: You'll always be running the app as classic.
