#Introduction

In this lab, you will show details on a business when the user taps on a map marker or on a list item.

#Steps


??Turn the Search container into a navigation view
 
You are going to show the detail panel when a business is selected. By changing the Search
container to a navigation view, you can do that by running *push* to add a child *search.Detail*.

The Navigation View is a specialized container in Sencha Architect. So we will need to refactor our
app quite a bit. Do not worry, your patience will be rewarded!

From the Toolbox, drag a Navigation View to the Views in the Project Inspector. This will create a new
class MyNavigationView. 

Under the MyNavigationView config, add a Navigation Bar. In the Code View, it will be empty. That's ok! We
will use it later. The Navigation Bar is a specialized toolbar for holding the Back button and managing
the UI.

Before we forget, the current search.Search view had a +page: map+ config to keep up with the current card. Add
this config to the MyNavigationView. Click on the current 'search.Search' view and migrate the 'updatePage' 
function. Now move the cards to the MyNavigationView class. Finally migrate the search.Toolbar, by ++carefully++ dragging 
it to MyNavigationBar under MyNavigationView.

The current search.Search view should be empty and you can safely delete it. Now the MyNavigationView can take its 
place. Update the configs +userClassName: search.Search+ and +userAlias: search+.

Drag the refactored search.Search view to the Main view and Link it. Move it to the first position then update the
+iconCls: search+ and +title: Search+ configs. In the Main view config, ensure +activeItem: 0+.

Save and refresh your app. You should not have an errors and everything should work as it did before.

Congrats! You have refactored your app to use a Navgiation View.

??Configure a custom event in the Map

Any observable object can fire an event. When doing an Event Binding,
Architect needs to know what events can be fired by the component. This
lab has you set up a custom event, then listen to it via a Basic Event Binding.
Look at the code for *search.Map*. The code in the *updateCoordinates* function
fires a *select* event, passing a reference to itself as the first parameter, and
the coordinate as the second parameter.

You would like the search tab to listen to that event, but you can't unless Architect
knows about the event.

To set that up, you need to create a *Custom Event*, which is a description of an event. 
It doesn't fire the event &mdash; it describes the event so you can listen to it elsewhere
via an Event Binding. 

Select *search.Map*, and filter for *Custom Events*. Add a new custom event named *select*, 
with the params *map,coordinate*. 


??Listen to the event in the Search tab

Select search.Search > cards > map. Update the +itemId: searchMap+. Add a Basic Event Binding
for the *select* event. (Because we added the Custom Event, the list of events will include 
*select*.) Use this code for the event handler:


        map.up('search').push({
            xtype: 'searchdetail',
            data: coordinate.record.data
        });
 
Save and refresh, then tap on a map marker. The detail page should slide into view.


??Make the toolbar bar look a little better
 
You probably noticed that the toolbar does not look very good as the detail page slides in.
That's because a navigation bar adds a Back button to the toolbar, and it's already so crowded
that the addition of the new button doesn't look good.
 
You will change the code to hide the search toolbar as the detail is shown.
 
Select *search.Search* and add a Basic Event Binding. Choose the *push* event and use this code:

    navigationview.down('#toolbar').hide();
    
Add another Basic Event Binding. Choose the *pop* event and use this code:

    navigationview.down('#toolbar').show();

This code will hide the search toolbar as the detail page slides in, and show it when the user presses back.

Save, refresh, and try it out by tapping on a map marker, then pressing Back.


??Enhance the detail panel
 
Select *search.Detail*. Modify its config by adding +padding: 8+ and set *tpl* to the following:
 
    <h1>{name}</h1>
    <h2>{[values.display_address.join("<br/>")]}</h2>
    <tpl if="image_url"><img src="{image_url}"/></tpl>

Save, refresh, and try it out by tapping a marker. You should the detail panel, with the new template.


??Setup the list drill-down too

Select the list that's linked within *search.Search* and add a Basic Event Binding. Listen to the *select*
event. 

For the event handler method, just copy and paste the code you wrote for the map's select listener.
Modify the code because the *select* event fired by a list is passed different parameters: 
the first is a reference to the +list+, and the second is the selected +record+. Modify the code accordingly,
then save and refresh. After you do a search, tap on List, then choose an item. The detail panel should Æ’slide
in, showing the selected business.
