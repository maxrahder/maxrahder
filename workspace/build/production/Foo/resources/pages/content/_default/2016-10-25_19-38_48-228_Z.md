#Introduction

In this lab you'll add the Hitchhikers Guide quotes application to the workspace.

#Steps

??Get the app source code

Download <a href="resources/student/labs/HitchhikersGuide.zip">the source `.zip` file</a> and unzip it to your `SenchaTest/workspace` folder

When you are finished, your `SenchaTest` directory will look like this:

    SenchaTest
        ext-6 
        workspace
            .sencha
            ext
            HitchhikersGuide
                app
                app.js
            packages
            workspace.json
            

??Generate the app infrastructure using Sencha Cmd

Use a terminal window to navigate to `SenchaTest/workspace/ext` and run this command

    sencha generate app -classic -starter=false HitchhikersGuide ../HitchhikersGuide

This creates the infrastructure needed to use the microloader and to do builds.

The `-classic` parameter creates the infrastructure needed for a classic-only application. 

The `-starter=false` parameter specifies that no starter source code is created &mdash; that's appropriate in 
this case because you already have the source, which will be preserved.

*HitchhikersGuide* is the name of the app &mdash; it's the namespace and prefix for all classes.
 `../HitchhikersGuide` is the relative path to the folder where the app is generated.
 




??Initialize the microloader and stylesheet

Since we omitted creating the normal starter app, you need to initialize the microloader
and generate the initial stylesheet. If we had started with the normal starter app, this
wouldn't be needed. (Although there'd be more starter code to clean up.)

Use a terminal window to navigate to `SenchaTest/workspace/HitchhikersGuide` and run this command

    sencha app build development


??Confirm that the server is running

You need Sencha Cmd's build-in server to be running with `SenchaTest/workspace` as the document root. 

If you haven't already done so, use a terminal window to naviate to the `SenchaTest/workspace` folder and
enter +sencha web start+. If you get the error *Address already in use*, that means the server is already
running in another terminal window &mdash; in that case, run `sencha web stop` then `sencha web start`.

The server runs on port 1841.


??Run the app

Using a web browser, you can see the Hitchhikers Guide app at <a href="http://localhost:1841/HitchhikersGuide/" target="lab">localhost:1841/HitchhikersGuide</a>.

Try it out: The dropdown lets you choose a quote from *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*, and the align button
aligns the quote.
