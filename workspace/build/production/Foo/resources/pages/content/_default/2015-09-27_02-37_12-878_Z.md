##The Code is Class-Based

Views and other items are coded as classes, which are reusable and extensible.

##The Code is Declarative

It *describes* the classes, containers, and components 
being used. This means that you focus on abstract, 
high-level types without having to worry about the details
of how they work or how they are rendered.
