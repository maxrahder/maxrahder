#Introduction

In this lab you'll try out the Event Recorder to record user interaction in the
HitchhikerGuide's app.

#Steps

??Create a new test scenario

In Studio, select the `Applications > HitchhikersGuide > Tests` project, and `Add` a scenario 
named *user* in a directory of the same name. Save your changes to update the navigation tree.


??Create a new Jasmine suite

You need a test that verifies that choices from the alignment button and from the title button bring about the proper results.

In the new `HitchhikersGuide > Tests > user` scenario, create a Jasmine test
suite named `view/quote/title/ChoiceContent.js`

Delete the default matcher, and change the suite description and spec to something more descriptive:

<pre class="runnable readonly 200">
describe("Choice.js align and title choices", function() {
    it("should update the page contents", function() {

    }); 
});</pre>


??Record user interaction

Now you need to start and stop the recorder, as a result of which the recorded +play([])+
will automatically be added to the spec.

In Studio, edit `ChoiceContent.js` and get an insertion point in the body of the
spec. Then click the Event Recorder button in the toolbar.

Then choose Chrome from the list of browsers. 

<img src="resources/images/senchatest/EventRecorderClicked.jpg"/>

Sencha Studio will launch a browser window: switch to that window and click on the 
right-align button, then choose *Babel Fish* from the list of titles. 

Studio updates the recorder dialog as you interact with the app.

After choosing the alignment and title, switch back to Studio and stop the recording 
by clicking `Insert Event Recording`

??Look at the play events

After stopping the recorder your +play()+ array should look something like this. (The x, y 
coordinates will be different.)

<pre class="runnable readonly 200">
describe("Choice.js align and title choices", function() {
    it("should update the page contents", function() {
        ST.play([
            { type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"fa-align-right\"]", x: 12, y: 15 },
            { type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 119, y: 8 },
            { type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Babel Fish\"]", x: 90, y: 15 }
        ]);
    });
});</pre>

If you used your keyboard to switch from Chrome back to Studio you may see a final
event that looks something like this: +{ type: "type", target: "#titlechoiceview", key: "Meta" }
+. That's the recording of you pressing Command-tab to switch back to Studio. You can delete that
entry.

<b>Important</b>: Note that the selector for the button is +fa-align-right+, but due to a 
bug in the recorder that's incomplete. The selector should actually be +x-fa fa-align-right+. 
Correct the selector to include +x-fa+.


??Modify the test to look at the page's text

If you recall, the futures API has methods that wait for component state. An +ST.Component+
method is +contentLike()+ which tests the component's inner HTML against a string or regex. 

The Babel Fish quote includes the text *small, yellow and leech-like*. You need to test for that.

But it's often better to have it fail, and then succeed. Therefore, modify the function's
code and remove the +expect(true).toBe(true)+ and instead, use a future to select the view and
test its content:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
describe("Choice.js align and title choices", function() {
    it("should update the page contents", function() {
        ST.play([
            {type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"x-fa fa-align-right\"]", x: 12, y: 15 }, 
            {type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 119, y: 8}, 
            {type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Babel Fish\"]", x: 90, y: 15 }
        ]);
        ST.component('quoteview').contentLike(/Bullwinkle J. Moose/); // Won't match
    });
});
</pre>

Run the test and it fails with the message *Timeout waiting for content to be like /Bullwinkle J. Moose/*

Now change the regex to look for the correct string: +contentLike(/small, yellow and leech-like/).+

Run the test again and it should succeed. Note that the Summary for the test shows the test passing, 
but there are no details below. That's because there's no +match()+ to report on. 
Recall from an earlier lab that tests succeed by default, and only fail if they time
out, or if an +expect()+ matcher fails. 


??Test for alignment too

There is no built-in state watcher for testing the text-align of an element. So you'll 
have to do some low-level DOM coding in the function.

To do that, add an +and()+ to the future and test the contents of the view:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
describe("Choice.js align and title choices", function() {
    it("should update the page contents", function() {
        ST.play([
            {type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"x-fa fa-align-right\"]", x: 12, y: 15 }, 
            {type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 119, y: 8}, 
            {type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Babel Fish\"]", x: 90, y: 15 }
        ]);
        ST.component('quoteview')
            .contentLike(/small, yellow and leech-like/);

        ST.element('quoteview => div[style*=text-align]')
            .and(function (div) {
                expect(div.dom.style.textAlign, 'right');
            });
    });
});
</pre>

Note the weird-looking statement that looks at the component's DOM. First, the selector is a hybrid
selector that uses both the parent component's +xtype+, and a DOM query to find the +div+ with the
text-align. Then the +and+ tests for the alignment value. 



??Create multiple instances

The HitchhikersGuide app is coded to show multiple instances of the view. Enable that feature by editing 
`app/view/main/Main.js` and un-comment the +tbar+ config. When you're finished, +Main.js+ will look
like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('HitchhikersGuide.view.main.Main', {
    extend: 'Ext.tab.Panel',
    xtype: 'app-main',
    requires: ['HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.QuoteView'],
    items: [{
        xtype: 'quoteview'
    }],
    tbar: [{
        text: 'New',
        xtype: 'button',
        handler: function(button) {
            var tabPanel = button.up('tabpanel');
            tabPanel.setActiveItem(tabPanel.add({
                xtype: 'quoteview'
            }));
        }
    }]
});
</pre>

Try it by using your browser to run the app &mdash; you can choose quotes and align them, and you can create
new instances of the quote page by clicking `New` in the toolbar. Note that each quote view works independently
of each other, thanks to the beauty of Sencha's Model/ViewModel/ViewController architecture.

??Create a test against two instances

Edit `user/view/quote/title/ChoiceContent.js`.

Add a new spec:

A UI change like this often breaks existing tests, but luckily the recorder used fairly soft-coded component 
references, so the *should update the page contents* test should still work.

<pre class="runnable readonly 100">
it("should update the page contents on multiple tabs", function() {

});</pre>

Put the editor cursor in the method body and click `Event Recorder`. Choose Chrome as the browser, and in the
newly spawned window choose center-align, then the title *Towels*, then click the toolbar `New` button, and 
choose right-align, then the title *Freedom*. Then stop the recording. The result should look something like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly 300">
ST.play([
    { type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"x-fa fa-align-center\"]", x: 13, y: 19 },
    { type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 120, y: 22 },
    { type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Towels\"]", x: 101, y: 8 },
    { type: "tap", target: "button[text=\"New\"]", x: 29, y: 24 },
    { type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"x-fa fa-align-right\"]", x: 18, y: 19 },
    { type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 115, y: 22 },
    { type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Freedom\"]", x: 78, y: 10 }
]);</pre>

??Run it

Even though your new spec doesn't have any tests, go ahead and run it, just to see if it plays.

And... it *fails* with the error *Timeout waiting for target (titlechoiceview[test="Choose a title"])...*

<img src="resources/images/senchatest/TwoQuoteViewFails.jpg"/>

Why? Because the previous spec chose right-align and Babel Fish, so when the second spec ran the
button text wasn't *Choose a title* any more. 

??Clean up code after each spec

It's a good idea to leave the view in its initial state after each spec. You can either do that
by initializing things in +beforeEach()+ or cleaning them up in +afterEach()+. In many cases it's
easier to clean things up at the end, because by that time you don't need futures to select the 
components.

Code an +afterEach()+ to clean up the views:

<pre class="runnable readonly 200">
afterEach(function() {
    Ext.Array.forEach(Ext.all('quoteview'), function(queryview) {
        queryview.getViewModel().set({
            title: 'Choose a title',
            align: 'left'
        });
    });
});</pre>

Now try running the test again.

This time you get past the first error, but another error occurs: *Failed with error "Component Query locator matches multiple items: "button[iconCls="x-fa fa-align-right"]""
*

That's because now there are two buttons that match that selector. 

This illustrates the challenges of testing. Test Engineers will often need to work with developers when writing tests. 


??Clean up the button selectors

Modify the code to select the `New` button, as before, but then get the +id+ of the newly created tab,
and use that in subsequent calls to +play()}+:

<pre class="runnable readonly 300">
it("should update the page contents on multiple tabs", function() {
    ST.play([
        { type: "tap", target: "button[iconCls=\"x-fa fa-align-center\"]", x: 13, y: 19 },
        { type: "tap", target: "titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 120, y: 22 },
        { type: "tap", target: "menuitem[text=\"Towels\"]", x: 101, y: 8 },
        { type: "tap", target: "button[text=\"New\"]", x: 29, y: 24 }
        ], function(){
           var id = '#' + Ext.first('app-main').getActiveTab().getId();
           ST.play([
                { type: "tap", target: id + " button[iconCls=\"x-fa fa-align-right\"]", x: 18, y: 19 },
                { type: "tap", target: id + " titlechoiceview[text=\"Choose a title\"]", x: 115, y: 22 },
                { type: "tap", target: id + " menuitem[text=\"Freedom\"]", x: 78, y: 10 }
            ]);
    });
});</pre>


Run the test, and both specs pass.

Note that a more advanced way of handing the issue of ambiguous selecors is by coding a 
custom +St.locator.Strategy+, and use it via +ST.addLocatorStrategy()+ and +ST.setLocatorStragegies()+.
