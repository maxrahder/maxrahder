###The `view` folder

Component sub-classes, or *views*, go in the views folder. The starter app automatically creates
the base container, named +view.main.Main+, in the corresponding file `view/main/Main.js`

If the view has a controller or view model, they will usually be in the same folder. For example, 
the starter app creates `view/main/MainController.js` and `view/main/MainViewModel.js`.

<div type="expander" caption="`view`">
This folder contains view declarations. Views are usually organized as one sub-folder per view, with each folder containing the view, the view model and view controller
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="app/model/">
This folder contains record definitions. Stores are collections of records, so store declarations reference these.
Despite its name, this folder has nothing to do with view controllers.
</div>

Not-so-important folders:

<div type="expander" caption="app/controller/">
This folder may contain global controller definitions. It's not used much.
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="app/store/">
This folder may contain store definitions, although most stores are defined declaratively in the view model.
</div>
