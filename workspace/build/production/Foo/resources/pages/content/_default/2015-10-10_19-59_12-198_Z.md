Mobile phones don't have much screen real estate. On phones, it's common to 
do some kind of drill-down to show details.

In the classic app, you used a popup window to show the preview. On a phone,

There are several Ext JS modern components for making it easy to switch 
between screens:

- Tab panels, like you used for the ISS app
- Carousels, which lets the user swipe from screen to screen
- Nested list, which shows a node in a tree, with built-in drill-down
- Navigation view, which is a container onto which you push views
