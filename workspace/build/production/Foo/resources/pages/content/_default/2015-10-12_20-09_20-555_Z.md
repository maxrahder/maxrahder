- **Ext JS Framework** - Need to have non-minified framework somewhere in your project. The plugin uses it to build definitions. 

- **Sencha CMD** - additional capabilities are available with Cmd installed.

NOTE: JetBrains revamped their javascript apis which we are using for our plugin, so older versions of their IDEs may not work.
