For Saucelabs you need to acquire a product named Sauce Connect.

Once installed, you use the +sc+ command to start the tunnel:

    sc -u saucelabs.user.id -k saucelabs-access-key

You're then free to use the connection pool when running tests in Studio &mdash;
your app will be run by SauceLabs via the tunnel.
