Controllers may need to update the user interface or look at component properties. 

For example, in response to a button click, the controller may need to hide or
reveal a panel, or submit a form.

There are two primary ways to get a component reference:

- Use the reference passed to the event handler
- Specify +reference+ on a component, then use +lookupReference()+ in the controller
