All calendar components require a +Ext.calendar.store.Calendars+ store. 

In other words, calendar views show all events for all calendars
within the configured calendars store.

To exclude the events for one of the calendars, run +setHidden(true)+
on the corresponding +Ext.calendar.model.Calendar+ record.
