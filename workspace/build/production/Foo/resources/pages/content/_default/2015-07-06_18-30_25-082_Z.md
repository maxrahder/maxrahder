The magic that makes all this happen is in the Viewport override for the hebrew locale:

<pre class="runnable readonly 160">Ext.define('Ext.locale.container.Viewport', {
    override: 'Ext.container.Viewport',
    requires: [
        'Ext.rtl.*'
    ],

    rtl: true
});</pre>

Two things happen here:
* we require +Ext.rtl.*+ which ensures all the overrides that provide rtl behavior are included
* and we set +rtl: true+ on the viewport which flips the entire application into rtl mode.

Since the ability to support _RTL_ is inherited through the component hierarchy, 
this is usually all you need. However, you can override it at any point in the hierarchy. 
If, for example, you want to display a LTR component inside of a rtl app, you could set +rtl:false+ 
on that component.
