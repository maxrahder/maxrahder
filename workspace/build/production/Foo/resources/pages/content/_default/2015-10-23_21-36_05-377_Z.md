A pivot grid (or table) provides a simple way to condense many data points into a format
that makes trends and insights more apparent. A classic example is sales data. A company 
will often have a record of all sales it makes for a given period. This will often 
encompass thousands of rows of data. 

The Pivot Grid allows you to see how well each salesperson performed, which cities 
generate the most revenue, how products perform between cities, etc.

In this section, we will code a *Salesperson Pivot Grid*.
