#Introduction

In this lab, you will code the high-level user interface by stubbing
out each view component and using it in the main viewport and tab panel.

#Steps 

??Review the requirements
 
Look at the user's sketch and discuss the key pieces of the user interface.

- The top container is a navigation view containing a top-docked toolbar and a tab panel.
- The toolbar holds two search fields used to specify the city and category
- The tab panel contains a map and a list of businesses
- Clicking on a business shows the detail panel
- The detail panel has an edit button that shows a form panel

Therefore, in this lab you will create these classes:

- +YelpExtplorer.view.main.Main+ (exists from starter)
- +YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.Filter+
- +YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.TabPanel+
- +YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.Map+
- +YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.List+

In future labs you'll create:
- +YelpExtplorer.view.business.Detail+
- +YelpExtplorer.view.business.Edit+


WARNING: As you create the different classes, keep in mind that some parts of the application relate to a <i>single</i> business, such as the detail panel and the business model, and some relate to <i>all</i> businesses, such as the grid and the businesses store. That means some class names and xtypes are singular and some are plural.



??Change the main view to a navigation view

The main view will hold a tab panel and, when businesses are selected, reveal the business detail page. 

Conceptually, a navigation view component holds a stack of pages, and shows the user the page on top.
Pages are pushed onto the stack via +push()+, and removed via +pop()+. When there is more than one page
on the stack, the user sees a Back button at the top of the page &mdash; pressing Back pops the page off
the stack.

Replace the contents of `modern/src/view/main/Main.js` with this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.Main', {
    extend: 'Ext.navigation.View',
    xtype: 'app-main',
    requires: [
        'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainController',
        'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel'
    ],

    controller: 'main-main',
    viewModel: {
        type: 'main-main'
    },

    items: [{
        title: 'YelpExtplorer',
        layout: 'fit',
        xtype: 'container',
        items: [{
            xtype: 'toolbar',
            docked: 'top',
            title: 'City/category filter goes here'
        }, {
            xtype: 'component',
            html: 'Tab panel goes here'
        }]
    }]
});
</pre>

Note that the navigation view has a single child, which is a container. The container has
a toolbar and a component. The toolbar is a placeholder for the toolbar that will hold the
city/category search fields, and the component is a placeholder for the tab panel.

The reason there's a container holding the toolbar and tab panel is that, as the detail
page is pushed on the navigation view, the entire container will slide over and be hidden.
If the toolbar and tab panel were directly under the navigation view, the toolbar would 
stay docked at the top when the detail page is pushed &mdash; that would look strange.

Save your changes and run the app in your web browser. Remember, to run as a modern app you 
need to either use emulation or add `?modern` as a URL query field.

You can test the navigation view functionality by using the Developer Tools console. Enter
these statements:

    var view = Ext.first('navigationview');
    view.push({title: 'Second'});
    
The code puts a reference to the nagivation view in *view*, then runs +push()+ to push
a component onto the navigation view's stack. You'll see the component slide into place,
and the toolbar will change to "Second" and a Back button will appear. Clicking Back pops
the page off the view.

??Define and use the tab panel

Create a new file named `modern/src/view/businesses/TabPanel.js`, containing this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.TabPanel', {
    extend: 'Ext.tab.Panel',
    xtype: 'businessestabpanel',
    requires: [],

    tabBar: {
        docked: 'bottom',
        defaults: {
            iconAlign: 'top'
        }
    },
    defaults: {
        iconAlign: 'top'
    },
    items: [{
        title: 'Map',
        iconCls: 'x-fa fa-map-marker'
    }, {
        title: 'List',
        iconCls: 'x-fa fa-list'
    }]

});
</pre>

Note the +xtype+. 

Edit `modern/src/view/main/Main.js` and add +YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.TabPanel+ to the 
requires array. Then replace the config for the stubbed out panel with the tab panel's xtype. Remove the +html+ config.
When you are finished, the main view's +items:[]+ will look like this:

    items: [{
        title: 'YelpExtplorer',
        layout: 'fit',
        xtype: 'container',
        items: [{
                xtype: 'toolbar',
                docked: 'top',
                title: 'City/category filter goes here'
            }, {
                xtype: 'businessestabpanel'
        }]
    }]
 
 Save, and then refresh the lab's browser window.
 
 Because we've created a new file, you might need to let the microloader know about the 
change by using a terminal window to navigate to `SenchaTraining/labs/yelpextplorer` and entering

    sencha app refresh

??Define and use the stubbed map

Create `modern/src/view/businesses/Map.js` and use this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly 200">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.Map', {
    extend: 'Ext.Component',
    xtype: 'businessesmap',
    requires: [],
    html: 'This is the map'
});
</pre>

Then require it in `modern/src/view/businesses/TabPanel.js` and use the new
xtype for the first tab.

<img src="resources/images/yelp/stub/StubbedMap.jpg" height="400"/>


??Add the stubbed list

This step is almost identical to the previous step. Here, you're defining the
stubbed out list and using it in the tab panel.

First, create `modern/src/view/businesses/List.js` and use this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly 200">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.List', {
    extend: 'Ext.Component',
    xtype: 'businesseslist',
    requires: [],
    html: 'This is the list'
});
</pre>

Then require it in `modern/src/view/businesses/TabPanel.js` and use the new
xtype for the second tab.

Test it by saving your changes, refreshing your web browser, and clicking on each tab. 



# Conclusion

Any code or config that creates an object &mdash; such as an item in the +items+ array, or the +viewModel+ 
or +controller+ config &mdash; will have a corresponding entry in the +requires:[]+. That's because
you can't create an instance of some type unless the type itself is loaded.
