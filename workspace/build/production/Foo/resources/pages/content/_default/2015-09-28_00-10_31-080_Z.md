Sencha Cmd created quite a few files! 

- You spend 95% of your time in the `app` folder, writing and using classes
- You may occasionally edit `app.json` to configure the app
- You may put resources, like images, into the `resoures` folder
- You may also occasionally edit styling within the `sass` folder
