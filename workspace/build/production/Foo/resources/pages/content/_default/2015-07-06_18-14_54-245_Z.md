Ext JS theming is done via scores of global and component-specific Sass variables. There
are also mixins you can include to create named styles that you can use on specific
components.

<div type="expander" caption="Global variables">
<ul class="plain">
<li>There are about 25 global variables whose values are used throughout a theme.</li>
<li>For example, <code>$base-color</code> and <code>$font-family</code> are
reflected everywhere in an application, these are all applied on <code>Ext.Component</code></li>
<li>See <a href="http://docs.sencha.com/extjs/6.0/6.0.1-classic/#!/api/Global_CSS" target="api">the API documentation</a> for a list of global variables.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Component variables">
<ul class="plain">
<li>Variables applied within the scope of the component, such as <code>Ext.button.Button</code></li>
<li>For example, <code>$button-default-color</code>, these are inheriting directly from the base variables and can be modified in the process.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Custom UIs">
<ul class="plain">
<li>A set of skins that can applied on certain components to modify the looks.</li>
<li>Components have a <code>ui</code> property that ties the component to the its styling.</li>
<li>There are some component ui mixins you can include to create your own ui name.</li>
<li>You can then use the new ui in your application.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Custom Sass">
<ul class="plain">
<li>Custom Sass variables or CSS rules, to override in case the above fails.</li>
</ul>
</div>
