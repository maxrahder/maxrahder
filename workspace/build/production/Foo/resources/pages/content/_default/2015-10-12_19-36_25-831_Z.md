#Introduction

In this lab, you'll use the  starter app as a great place to try out the theming features of Fashion

?? Open Sencha Inspector

Open Inspector.

Sencha Inspector must be open before we can attach our app to it for theming. 

?? Creating a Starter App

Using a terminal window, navigate to `/ext/` and copy-and-paste this command:

    sencha generate app -classic FashionDemo ../fashiondemo

<img src="resources/images/inspector/starter.jpg"/>

?? Setup the `app.json` file for easier use with Inspector

In a Classic app, s/b around line 107, uncomment the following line of code
    
    "save": "sass/save.scss",
    
What did we just do?

The code "save": "sass/save.scss", assures that any changes you make to your file are automatically saved to 
a save.scss file and will be part of any build.

?? Run +sencha app watch+

Using a terminal window, navigate to the app folder and type

    sencha app watch -fashion -inspector 
    
TIP: You could also run `sencha app watch -f -i`    
    
What did we just do?

These two options being run for app watch allow us to run inspector and fashion to  

?? Run your App

In a browser, navigate to localhost:1841

?? Select the app in Inspector and navigate to the Theme tab

Double-clicking the app, which should now be in your Inspector window, will open up the Inspector App for your application. 
Navigate to the theme </ > tab.

?? Using Fashion to change the look of the app 

At the top of the Theme tab, are the following buttons, as well as the buttons you will see at the right
as you change the values of variables.

They are:

* **Changed Values** is very handy to see *only* the items that have been altered.
* **Copy Changes** places all changed vaules on a clipboard so they could be moved to a separate scss file
* **Reset All** would reset all values to their defaults 

& 

* **Reset** at the end of each changed variable allows you to reset a variable of your choosing.

Each of these can be very helpful. The view in the screenshot shows the buttons as well as all the variables 
that we will be changing. In a few minutes, we will completely change the look of the app

We'll be changing the following variables

Here are the values we are changing in Fashion (feel free to copy the values to save time

    $base_color - #462c66ff
    $font_family - 'Impact', 'Charcoal', 'san-serif'
    $font_size - 15px
    $grid_header_background_color - #8040adff
    $grid_column_header_color - #fdfdfde2
    $grid_row_cell_font_family - 'Courier New', 'Courier', 'monospace'
    $grid_row_cell_font_size - 16px
    $grid_row_cell_over_background_color - #7d3dbdff
    $grid_row_cell_over_color - #fffcfcff
    $grid_row_cell_selected_background_color - #f0e1ffff
    $line_height - 22px
    $panel_body_background_color - #b3a9c2ff 
    $panel_body_color - #fcf6f6ff
    $panel_body_font_family - 'Verdana', 'Geneva', 'san-serif'
    $panel_body_font_size - 18px
    
Since we are +running sencha app watch+, we can also make changes in our scss files and also instantly see
updates to those files.

###Mixins###

Open sass/src/view/main/**Main.scsss**

We're going to change some variables in the UI mixin.

**extjs-tab-panel-ui --- navigation**

    $ui-tab-font-size: 18px,
    $ui-tab-font-size-over: 19px,
    $ui-tab-font-size-active: 18px,
    $ui-tab-glyph-color-active: #C266E0,
    $ui-tab-background-color: #442F57,
    $ui-bar-background-color: #553B6D,

**extJS-panel-ui --- navigation**
 
    $ui-header-background-color: #7A3D99,
    
Your app after the changes

??Stop sencha app watch

From the command line, where you started sencha app watch, stop the server 

    CTRL-C

??Do a build to make changes persist when not using app watch

From the `fashiondemo` directory, run

    sencha app build development
    
NOTE: Fashion is generating CSS in the browser. Running a build is necessary to compile your code into CSS. 

??Start the server in the `SenchaTraining` folder

From the terminal where you started the server earlier, navigate to `SenchaTraining`, then enter

    sencha web start

??Run fashiondemo through the Jetty server

 <a href="http://localhost:1841/fashiondemo/" target="_blank">http://localhost:1841/fashiondemo/</a>

# Conclusion

In this lab, you themed your app in Inspector using the Theme tab and saw just how quickly the new Fashion compiler allowed
you to see the new styling. You then saved those changes into a build. If you were to use sencha app watch again, you would see 
that the Theme tab would populate with the changes you had previously made.
