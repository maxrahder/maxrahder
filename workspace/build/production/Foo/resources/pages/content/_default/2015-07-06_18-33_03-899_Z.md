#Introduction

In the Theming unit, you used Sencha Cmd to build your application. We will now explore the files that 
were generated from that build. 


#Steps#

??Do a production build

There are three build options: production, testing and development build. Depending on the type of
build, either a `production`, `testing` or `development` folder is created. The default is `production`.

Open a terminal window and navigate to the `SenchaTraininglabs/yelpextplorer` folder.
Then run this command:

    sencha app build production

??Familiarize yourself with the structure of the `build` folder

The production build process creates a new `labs/build/production/YelpExtplorer/` folder. 

Inside the build folder you will find `app.js`, `index.html` and `app.json`. 

The index file contains the microloader. The microloader also uses information in `app.json`.

Now note that the size of `app.js` is about 1.7 megabyte. Compare that to the size of `ext-all.js` found 
in your original install of Ext JS &mdash; it's slightly over 2 megabytes. The build process
determined the components being used in YelpExtplorer, and included only
those in `app.js`, thus reducing the overall size of the library by about 25%.


??Compare the load behavior of your dev and build applications

Visit your development application at `labs/yelpextplorer` and look 
at the number of source files loaded. There are a couple of hundred 
files being loaded as your <code>requires</code>, <code>extend</code> 
and other dependencies are being evaluated. 

Now visit the built application at 
`labs/build/production/yelpextplorer` and look at the number of source files loaded. There is now a 
*single* JavaScript file being loaded!

Refresh the page again, and you'd see that the request for `app.js` results in a 304. Browsers
can include an +If-Modified-Since+ header, which specifies the time stamp of when page was last 
fetched. Servers return a 304 &mdash; and no content &mdash; if the file hasn't changed since
that date. That tells the browser to use its last-fetched copy. In other words, when the user 
first visits the app, the app is cached locally.


#Conclusion

That's all there is to the build process. It's easy to do, but it has a 
profound impact on your application. It reduces network traffic to a single 
JavaScript file and also reduces the overall size of the code being loaded. 
In our case, the load time is also cut in half.
