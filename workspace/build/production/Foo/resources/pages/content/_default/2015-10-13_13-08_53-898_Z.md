The “Theming” tab relies upon functionality provided by Fashion, a new mechanism to compile SASS themes into CSS. 
Therefore, Sencha Inspector allows applications built with Ext JS 6 (and Sencha Cmd) to change theme values on-the-fly.

To enable this feature, you will first need to meet few criteria – please read the Live Theming guide.

NOTE: The Theming tab may be disabled because the live theming capabilities of Sencha Inspector depend on having 
a local Sencha Cmd process. This is disabled for the Demo application.

We'll be looking at theming later on a live app.
