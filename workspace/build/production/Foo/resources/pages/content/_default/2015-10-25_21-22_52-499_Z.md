#Introduction 

In this lab, you'll get the Movies app running.


??Generate the starter app

Using a terminal window, navigate to `SenchaTraining/ext/` and run

    sencha generate app -classic -starter=false Movies ../movies

Delete the `SenchaTraining/labs/movies/sass` folder and the `SenchaTraining/labs/movies/app.json` file.
    
??Download the code

The code, Sass and styling for the app are found in <a href="resources/movies.zip">movies.zip</a>.
Unzip it somewhere, and move the `app.json`, and `app`, `sass` and `resources` folders to `SenchaTraining/labs/movies`.

??Initialize the microloader and stylesheet

Using a terminal window, navigate to `SenchaTraining/labs/movies` and run

    sencha app build development

??Run the app

Run the app via <a href="http://localhost:1841/movies/" target="lab">http://localhost:1841/movies/</a>

Try clicking on a few movies and actors.

??Look at the code

The app has a few interesting things:

- Look at `app/data/CachedAjax.js` and note that the data is cached
- Look at the main view, and base view classes &mdash; there's a lot of reuse
