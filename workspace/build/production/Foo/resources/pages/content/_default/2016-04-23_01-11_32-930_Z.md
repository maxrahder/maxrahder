#Introduction

In the HitchhikersGuide app, the dropdown list of titles is configured in the view's
items array. That code is a little complex, so you're going to move it into
its own class, with an +xtype+, and use that +xtype+ in the items array. 

That means you'll want to set up an integration test for the new view class.


#Steps

??Run the app again

Run <a href="http://localhost:1841/HitchhikersGuide/" target="lab" />the HitchhikersGuide app</a> again. 

As you click the dropdown of titles, the corresponding quote is shown in the body of the page.

??Review the code you're going to refactor

Using a code editor, open `HitchhikersGuide/app/view/quote/QuoteView.js` and look at the +tbar+ config. 
It contains three things: an instance of +choosealign+ (which is defined in `ChooseAlign.js`), a +tbseparator+,
and an instance of +splitbutton+. 

The +splitbutton+ config is a little complicated, and the way it handles click events on its menu items is 
a little strange. You're going to refactor the split-button to be its own class.


??Model the class

Pretend that you got out some index cards and modeled the new view class. 
The class is pretty simple: It has a published property &mdash; +value+ &mdash; and fires a +change+ event.

??Stub out the class

Create the file `app/view/quote/title/Choice.js` using this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly 100">
Ext.define('HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.title.Choice', {
    extend: 'Ext.Container',
    xtype: 'titlechoiceview'
});</pre>

Eventually this class needs to extend +Ext.button.Split+, like the component it's replacing,
but since we're only stubbing it out, we'll start it a something generic, like a container. 

Note the +xtype+. 


??Use the new class

Edit `app/view/quote/QuoteView.js` and add a +requires+ entry for 
*HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.title.Choice*. 

<pre class="readonly text runnable 160">
requires: [
    'HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.ChooseAlign',
    'HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.QuoteViewModel',
    'HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.QuoteViewController',
    'HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.title.Choice'
],
</pre>

Then change the +tbar+ array to use your new component:

<pre class="readonly text runnable 300">
tbar: [{
        xtype: 'choosealign',
        bind: {
            value: '{align}'
        }
    },
    '-', {
        xtype: 'titlechoiceview',
        //bind: {
        //    value: '{title}'
        //}
    }
]
</pre>

The binding is commented out for now.


??Create a Jasmine test 

In Sencha Studio, *Add* a new scenario at `HitchhikersGuide > Tests`. Choose the `In-browser` test type. Name it +integration+, and also name the 
directory +integration+.

Then add a Jasmine test suite to the new scenario. Name it +view/quote/title/Choice.js+ and use the following
code.

<pre class="runnable readonly 200">
describe("view/quote/title/Choice.js", function() {
    
    it("should keep the button text and value in sync", function() {
        var choice = Ext.create('HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.title.Choice');
        choice.setValue('Foo');
        expect(choice.getText()).toBe('Foo');
        expect(choice.getText()).toBe(choice.getValue());
    });
});</pre>

The new class has a *value* property which should be reflected on the split button's *test* property.
The test confirms that, and also tests the *value* setter and getter.

(You could argue that testing a +config+ property's getter and setter is unnecessary, since that's 
testing the functionality of the Ext JS library itself.)


??Run the test

The test should fail because the +choice.setValue()+ won't exist until you
start to implement the view class.

??Implement more of the new view class

Replace the code in +view/quote/title/Choice.js+ with this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.title.Choice', {
    extend: 'Ext.button.Split',
    xtype: 'titlechoiceview',

    config: {
        value: 'Choose a title'
    },
    updateValue: function(value) {
        // This method updates the view to reflect the value.
        this.setText(value);
    },
    menu: {
        defaults: {
            handler: function(item) {
                // Have "value" reflect the user's menu item choice 
                item.up('titlechoiceview').setValue(item.text);
            }
        },
        items: [{
            text: 'Towels'
        }, {
            text: 'Babel Fish'
        }, {
            text: 'Freedom'
        }]
    }
});
</pre>

The code adds a +value+ property (with a corresponding getter and setter), and keeps the 
split button's +text+ in sync. 

Rerun the test and it should pass.

??Add another spec

You also want to test whether the +change+ event fires. Add a spec to the  +Choice.js+ test suite:

<pre class="runnable readonly 300">
it("should fire change", function() {
    var choice = Ext.create('HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.title.Choice');
    var o = {
        onChange: function(component, value) {
            expect(value).toBe('Foo');
        }
    };
    spyOn(o, 'onChange').and.callThrough(); // Spy on the callback, and also let it run.
    choice.on('change', o.onChange, o); // Listen to the change, scoped to "o"
    choice.setValue('Foo'); // Run the setter, which should result in the event being fired.
    expect(o.onChange).toHaveBeenCalled(); // Verify that the callback was run.
});</pre>

Note the use of the spy to verify that the event handler attached to the object *o* is called. 
By default, the spy would completely intercept the call, which means that the handler wouldn't be reached.
But the +and.callThrough()+ allows the spied-upon method to be run.

In this example, the tests are a little redundant: the spy tests whether +onChange+ was called, but the listener
also has an expectation (that tests for the passed value). With the expectation in the handler 
you don't really need the spy.

Run the test, and the new spec should fail, because you haven't implemented that part of the view yet.

??Add event handling

To fire the event, edit `app/view/quote/title/Choice.js` and add a single statement to +updateValue+:

<pre class="runnable text readonly 130">
updateValue: function(value) {
    // This method updates the view to reflect the value.
    this.setText(value);
    this.fireEvent('change', this, value);
}</pre>

Rerun the integration test and it should pass.


??Add a spec to detect a value being published

*Publishing* a property means that, when binding, its value is automatically 
pushed onto the view model. Add a new spec to the +Choice.js+ test suite: 

<pre class="runnable readonly 270">
it("should publish its value", function(done) {
    var choice = Ext.create('HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.title.Choice', {
        viewModel: {},
        bind: {
            value: '{foo}'
        },
        renderTo: Ext.getBody() // Needed for the binding to kick in
    });
    choice.getViewModel().bind('{foo}', function() {
        done();
    });
    choice.setValue('bar');
});</pre>

Run the test. The new spec initially fails; it times out because the +done();+ statement is never run.

??Publish the property

Edit `app/view/quote/title/Choice.js` and add a single statement that publishes +value+:

        publishes: ['value']

The test should pass. <tt>:-)</tt>



??Clean up the test

Just to be tidy, you should explicitly delete the +HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.title.Choice+
instances after each spec is run. One way to do that is to define a variable +choice+ (available to 
each spec via closure scope) and then code an +afterEach+ to destroy it. Each spec should then 
create the choice instance into the +choice+ variable. Here's an example:

<pre class="runnable text readonly">
describe("view/quote/title/Choice.js", function() {

    var choice;
    
    afterEach(function(){
        if (choice){
            choice.destroy();
        }
    });


    it("should keep the button text and value in sync", function() {
        choice = Ext.create('HitchhikersGuide.view.quote.title.Choice');
        choice.setValue('Foo');
        expect(choice.getText()).toBe('Foo');
        expect(choice.getText()).toBe(choice.getValue());
    });
    
    // YOUR OTHER SPECS FOLLOW BELOW vv
    
</pre>

Edit the `Choice.js` test suite, adding the +choice+ var and the +afterEach+. Then modify each spec
to use the +choice+ in closure scope, rather than a local variable. 


??Clean up the code

Now that your new component publishes its value, you can uncomment the binding in 
`app/view/quote/QuoteView.js`. 

<pre class="runnable readonly text 130">
{
    xtype: 'titlechoiceview',
    bind: {
        value: '{title}'
    }
}</pre>

The binding results in the +titlechoiceview+ component's published property being
automatically pushed to the view model +title+.

??Verify that the application still works

Now that you've done the refactoring, 
run <a href="http://localhost:1841/HitchhikersGuide/" target="lab" />the HitchhikersGuide app</a> again
and verify that everything works.
