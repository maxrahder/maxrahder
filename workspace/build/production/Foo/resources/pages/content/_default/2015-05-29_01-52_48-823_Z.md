#Introduction
 
Your instructor has three zip files:
 - The beta release of Ext JS 6
 - Cmd 6
 - `Ext_6.zip`, which holds the YelpExtplorer starter app

#Steps

??Get the student folder

Get a copy of `ExtJS_6.zip` and unzip it in `SenchaTraining`. When you are finished, your 
folder hierarchy should be:

    SenchaTraining
        ExtJS_6
            shared
            yelpextplorer

??Get the library

Take the ext-6.0.x zip file provided by your instructor, and un-zip it into the `ExtJS_6`
folder. Then rename it `ext`. When you are finished, your folder hierarchy should be:

    SenchaTraining
        ExtJS_6
            ext
            shared
            yelpextplorer


??Install Cmd version 6

Get the version of Sencha Cmd for your operating system and install it. When you are
finished, verify the install by opening a *new* terminal window and typing the following.

    sencha which

You should see that Cmd 6.x is installed.

Note that it's important to open a new terminal window, because the path established 
during the install process may not be known to previously opened terminal windows.
