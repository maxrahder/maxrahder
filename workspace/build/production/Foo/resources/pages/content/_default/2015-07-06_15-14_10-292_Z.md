#Introduction

In this lab, you will code a popup window used to edit the selected business record.

#Steps

??Review the requirements

We need to enhance the detail panel by adding an Edit button in a +tbar+ and a link to Yelp in a +bbar+.

Clicking the edit button opens a window containing a form panel used to edit business information. The form
should be initialized with data from the selected business and, upon saving, should update the business record.

Note the key aspects of the window: 
- It contains a single child &mdash; a form panel
- The form panel has two components &mdash; a text field and a slider
- The form panel has a Save and a Cancel button

??Add the Edit toolbar to the detail panel

Edit `classic/src/view/business/Detail.js`.

Add a +tbar+ with a button with +text:'Edit'+ and +disabled: true+.

Then bind to the business, so it's enabled or disabled, depending on whether there is a selected business:

    bind: {
        disabled: '{!business}'
    }

Add a +bbar+ with a single item, configured like this:

    {
        xtype: 'component',
        height: 25,
        width: 155,
        html: [
            '<a href="http://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">',
            '<img src="resources/images/Powered_By_Yelp_Red.png"/></a>'
        ]
    }

Save and refresh, and verify that you can see the two toolbars, and verify that the Edit button is initially
disabled, and becomes enabled when you select a business.


??Use Sencha Cmd to generate the edit business window class

Use Sencha Cmd to generate the view +business.edit.Window+. Sencha Cmd will create the 
specified view and its associated view model and view controller. 

To do this, use a terminal window, and from within the `yelpextplorer` project folder type:

    sencha generate view business.edit.Window

Sencha Cmd places the view in the app folder. We want it in `classic/src/view/business`. Move it and use Sencha Cmd to run +sencha app refresh+.

??Make the class a window

Edit `classic/src/view/business/edit/Window.js`. Have it extend +Ext.window.Window+ and 
give it +xtype:'editbusinesswindow'+. Remove the +html+ property.

When you are finished it should look like this:

    Ext.define("YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.Window", {
	    extend: "Ext.window.Window",
    	xtype: "editbusinesswindow",
	    requires: [
	        'YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.WindowController',
    	    'YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.WindowModel'
	    ],
    	controller: "business-edit-window",
	    viewModel: {
	        type: 'business-edit-window'
    	}
    });


??Show the edit window when the user selects Edit

Edit `classic/src/view/business/Detail.js` and put a handler on the edit button. Have 
it run +onEditClick+ in the business detail controller.

Edit `classic/src/view/business/DetailController.js` and implement the event handler. For now
just show the window with a hard-coded title and a set height and width:

    onEditClick: function(button) {
	    Ext.create({
		    xtype: 'editbusinesswindow',
    		title: 'Business',
	    	height: 200,
		    width: 300,
    		autoShow: true
	    });
    }

As usual, since the code is creating an object, you need to require the class.
In this case, that means adding the edit business window class to the controller's +requires:[]+.

If you save and refresh, then select a business and click the edit button, you should see the
edit window.

??Pass the business to the window

We have a dilemma. Since we're creating the window *without* putting it in the containment
hierarchy of the main view model, the window doesn't have access to the selected business.
The detail view controller does, but not the window. We have to make the record available
to the window.

One way to address this would be to change the code to add the window as a child of the viewport;
but that would mean moving the +onEditClick+ to the main view controller. Another way to do it is to
pass the selected business to the window's view model as we create it. 

Replace the code that creates the window with this:

    onEditClick: function(button) {
    	Ext.create({
	    	xtype: 'editbusinesswindow',
		    title: 'Business',
		    height: 200,
	        width: 300,
		    autoShow: true,
		    viewModel: {
			    data: {
				    business: this.getViewModel().get('business')
    			}
	    	}
    	});
    }

The code sets the *business* property on the edit window's view model to reference
the business record in the viewport's view model.


??Start coding the form
 
Edit `classic/src/view/business/edit/Window.js` and use this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define("YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.Window", {
	extend: 'Ext.window.Window',
	xtype: 'editbusinesswindow',
	requires: ['YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.WindowController','YelpExtplorer.view.business.edit.WindowModel','Ext.form.Panel'],
	controller: 'business-edit-window',
	viewModel: {
		type: 'business-edit-window'
	},
	resizable: false,
	bodyPadding: 8,
	modal: true,

	layout: 'fit',
	
	items: [{
		xtype: 'form',
		reference: 'form',
		items: [
		    // Text field goes here
		],
		buttons: [{
			text: 'Save'
		}, {
			text: 'Cancel'
		}]
	}]

});
</pre>

Inspect the code. The window has a single item &mdash; a form. It uses layout *fit*, since 
there's only one item, and we want it to take up all the available space. It's modal, and
not resizable. It has padding, so the form fields don't touch the edges of the window. 
It also has Save and Cancel buttons. 


??Add a text field to the form

Add a text field to the form: +xtype:'textfield'+  and +fieldLabel:'Name'+. Bind its *value*
property to *{business.name}*.

Recall that +name+ is a key property of input fields. We would specify +name+ if
we were doing a form submit because the name-value pair is submitted to the back end.
But in this case we'll be binding to the business record, so the record will hold the 
data. Therefore, we don't need to specify a +name+ for the field.

Save and refresh. Choose a business, click edit and you should see the window and text field. The text
field should show the name of the selected record. Note that as you edit the name, the grid, the view
and the detail panel, all automatically reflect the change! That's because the text field is bound to 
the record's *name* property, so everything bound to it reflects the change.

??Detect when the user presses Save and Cancel

Add a handler to the Save button, and have it run *onSaveClick*. Add a handler to the Cancel
button, and have it run *onCancelClick*. 

Edit `classic/src/view/business/edit/WindowController.js` and implement the *onSave* and *onCancel* 
methods. Initially, have each just log a console message so you know they are being run. 
<pre>
onSaveClick: function(button){
	console.log('onSave');
},
onCancelClick: function(button){
	console.log('onCancel');
}
</pre>

At this point, clicking on Save or Cancel will not do anything. (You can still close the window by 
clicking the X in the upper right corner of the window.) 


??Have the Cancel button reject changes to the record

Records keep track of their original values. So even though you're editing the record as
you change the name, you can reject the change when the user presses Cancel. 

Modify the code to have +onCancelClick+ get a reference to the business record from the view model and 
run its +reject()+ method. Then close the the window. How do you programatically close a window? First you 
need a reference to the window, which you can get via +this.getView()+, then you need to run a 
method to close it. You could guess the name of the method for closing a window, or you can look 
it up in the API docs. 

When you are finished editing +onCancelClick+, the method will have
two statements &mdash; the first statement rejects changes to the record, and the second statement closes the window.

Save your changes, then select the grid tab and select a business. Then open the edit
window and change the name of a business. If you press Cancel, the record should revert to its original value.


??Have the Save button commit changes to the record

Edit the +onSaveClick+ method and have it commit the changes to the record. You need to do that because 
the +reject()+ method reverts to the *previously committed values*. To commit changes, get a reference 
to the business record from the view model and form, and run its +commit()+ method. Then close the window. 

When you are finished editing +onSave+, the method will have two statements &mdash; the first statement 
commits changes to the record, and the second statement closes the window.

Save your changes, then test things out by editing a record and pressing Save, re-editing the record, 
making changes and pressing Cancel, and so forth.


??Add record validation
 
There are two ways to validate data: either on the form field, or in the record. We'll do the latter.
 
Edit `app/model/Business.js` and add a field config for *name* &mdash; this makes the name field required:
    
    fields: [{
        name: 'name',
        validators: [{
            type: 'presence'
        }]
    }, {
        name: 'latitude',
        mapping: 'location.coordinate.latitude'
    }, {
        name: 'longitude',
        mapping: 'location.coordinate.longitude'
    }]

??Wire up the form to use record validation 

Edit `classic/src/view/business/edit/Window.js` and add +modelValidation:true+ to the form's config. This
config looks at any field bound to a value, and validates on the associated record's validators.
Be careful to add this to the form's config, and not to the config for the window or field.

In addition, add +formBind:true+ to the Save button's config. This will enable or disable the button
based on whether the form is valid. 

Save, refresh, and test your changes by editing a business and emptying the name. You should see 
a red border around the field, indicating that it's invalid, and the Save button should become disabled.
If you hover over the field you should see the default error message for the validator.

#Optional challenge

??Use the rating widget
 
Add a second item to the form: a rating widget. (You'll be doing this on your own.)

The code will be similar to the widget config used in the grid, but in addition, you'll need to bind 
its +value+ property to the *{business.rating}*.

When you're finished, save and refresh your browser window. If you edit a business you should see both 
the name and star rating being updated.
