Jasmine processes +beforeEach()+ before each specification is run, and 
+afterEach()+ runs after each. This lets you
do setup before running each spec, or a tear-down after each spec. Thus, all specs 
can have the same starting or ending state.

<pre class="runnable readonly">describe("A spec using beforeEach and afterEach", function() {
    var foo = 0;

    beforeEach(function() {
        foo += 1;
    });

    afterEach(function() {
        // Without this, foo would be 2 before the second spec
        foo = 0;
    });

    it("it should be incremented from zero", function() {
        expect(foo).toEqual(1);
    });

    it("it should still be incremented from zero", function() {
        expect(foo).toEqual(1);
    });
});
</pre>

There is also a +beforeAll()+ and +afterAll()+
