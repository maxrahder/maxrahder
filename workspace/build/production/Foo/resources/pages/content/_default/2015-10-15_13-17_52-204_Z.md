As an alternative, you can add a few lines of code that will connect your application to Sencha Inspector.

First, open app.json and locate the “js” array. Next, edit it to include following lines:

    "js" : [
    
          ..//existing scripts
    
          {
               // default settings
               "path" : "http://local.senchainspector.com:1839/inspector.js",
    
               // Or Use your Machine Name
               //"path" : "http://MyComputerName:1839/inspector.js",
    
               // Or Use your IP Address
               //"path" : "http://123.456.78.90:1839/inspector.js",
    
               "remote"    : true,
               "bootstrap" : true
          }
    
     ]
     
After adding this configuration to app.json, you also need to add initialization code to your app. Locate +{appRoot}/app/Application.js+ and then modify it to include the launch() method as in example below.

    //Do not modify entire Application.js - "DemoClient" is just an example name  
    
     Ext.define('DemoClient.Application', {  
          extend: 'Ext.app.Application',       
          name: 'DemoClient',  
    
          stores: [  
               'Users'  
          ],  

      //Add Sencha Inspector init to launch function  
      launch: function () {
          // <debug>
          try {
              /**
               * init() defaults to "http://local.senchainspector.com:1839"
               * so we don't have to pass a URL
               */
              SenchaInspector.init();


              /**
               * NOTE: The URL needs to match what you defined in app.json.
               * If you connected app.json via a machine name or IP address,
               * you'll need to explicitly configure that here too
               */
              // SenchaInspector.init('http://MyComputerName:1839');
          } catch (e) {}
          // </debug>
      }
    });
    
Notice that we’re wrapping the call to init() inside debug flags. Sencha Cmd will ignore all code between those blocks during a production build.

Finally, use Sencha Cmd to run sencha app watch. This will allow you to preview your application in browser at +http://localhost:1841+. If the configuration is correct, Sencha Inspector should automatically detect it and allow you to inspect the application.
