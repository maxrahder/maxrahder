A NavigationView is basically a Ext.Container with a card layout, so only one view can be visible at a time. However, NavigationView also adds extra functionality on top of this to allow you to push and pop views at any time. When you do this, your NavigationView will automatically animate between your current active view, and the new view you want to push, or the previous view you want to pop.

Using the NavigationView is very simple. Here is a basic example of it in action:

<pre class="runnable ipadframe run">
var view = Ext.create('Ext.NavigationView', {
    fullscreen: true,

    items: [{
        title: 'First',
        items: [{
            xtype: 'button',
            text: 'Push a new view!',
            handler: function() {
                // use the push() method to push another view. It works much like
                // add() or setActiveItem(). it accepts a view instance, or you can give it
                // a view config.
                view.push({
                    title: 'Second',
                    html: 'Second view!'
                });
            }
        }]
    }]
});
</pre>
