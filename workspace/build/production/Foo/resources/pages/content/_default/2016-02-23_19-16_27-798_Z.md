For any test, you need a known starting state. 

In the case of end-to-end testing, you often need the *database* to be in a known initial state. 

One way to accomplish this is to create a back-end service that initializes the database. 
The test suite would call the service &mdash; and initialize the database &mdash; before running any 
tests.

Another technique is to use *simlets*, which are classes that intercept Ajax calls
and return test data.
