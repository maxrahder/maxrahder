#What about constructor functions?

Javascript has *constructor functions*, which are functions intended to initialize newly created objects.
When using the Sencha class system, you don't call constructor functions directly.<small><sup>*</sup></small>
Other frameworks don't have a class system, so in those frameworks constructor functions play a prominent role. 

<pre class="runnable 300">var Person = function(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.speak = function() {
        alert('Hello, my name is ' + this.name);
    };
    return this;
};

// "new" simply runs a function in the context of a newly created object.
// The following two statements do the same thing.

var a = new Person('Hubert');
var b = Person.call({}, 'Fred');  

a.speak(); // alerts 'Hello, my name is Hubert'
b.speak(); // alerts 'Hello, my name is Fred'
</pre>

<small>*This refers to constructor functions in generic JavaScript. ExtJS has
a class system that include constructors &mdash; we will cover that later in class.</small>
