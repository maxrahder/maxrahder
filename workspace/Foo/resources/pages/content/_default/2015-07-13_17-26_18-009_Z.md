#Introduction

In this lab you'll finish the detail panel, and show it as the user selects a business.

#Steps

??Create the detail page

Create a file named `modern/src/view/business/Detail.js` using the following code. Note that you are creating the `business` folder (as differentiated
from the `businesses` folder that you created previously).

<pre class="runnable readonly 240">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.business.Detail', {
    extend: 'Ext.Container',
    xtype: 'businessdetail',

    cls: 'businessesdetail',
    padding: 8,
    html: 'detail'

});
</pre>

??Show the page as the user selects an item

When the user selects an item you need to push an instance of the detail page onto the navigation view.

To do that, edit `modern/src/view/main/MainController.js` and replace the +onBusinessSelect+ method
with this code:

    onBusinessSelect: function(business) {
        if (business) {
            this.getView().push({
                xtype: 'businessdetail',
                title: 'Business Detail'
            });
        }
    }

Note that this code creates an instance of the business detail, then pushes it onto the navigation view.
But you can't create an object without requiring it, so you also need to add a +requires+ entry:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainController', {
    extend: 'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainControllerShared',
    alias: 'controller.main-main',
    requires: ['YelpExtplorer.view.business.Detail'],
    initViewModel: function(vm) {
        var me = this;
        me.callParent(arguments);
        vm.bind('{business}', me.onBusinessSelect, me);
    },
    onBusinessSelect: function(business) {
        if (business) {
            this.getView().push({
                xtype: 'businessdetail',
                title: 'Business Detail'
            });
        }
    }
});
</pre>

Save and refresh. If you get some kind of class-not-found error eminating from `bootstrap.js`, then the microloader
may be confused about where the new view class exists.

If that happens, use a terminal window to go to the `SenchaTraining/labs/yelpextplorer`
folder and do a +sencha app refresh+. Then refresh the browser window.

Click on an item, and you should see the detail page slide into place. Pressing Back pops it off
the navigation view and you'll be back on the map.

??Put a template on the detail page

Edit `modern/src/view/business/Detail.js` and replace the contents with this:

<pre class="runnable">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.business.Detail', {
    extend: 'Ext.Container',
    xtype: 'businessdetail',

    cls: 'businessesdetail',
    padding: 8,
    tpl: [
        '<b>{name}</b>',
        '<br>',
        '{[values.location.display_address.join("<br>")]}',
        '<br><br>',
        '<tpl if="image_url"><img src="{image_url}"/></tpl>',
        '<br><br>',
        '<tpl if="is_closed"><i style="color: red;" class="fa fa-times-circle"></i> This business is permanently closed.<br><br></tpl>',
        'Web site: {url}',
        '<br><br>',
        '<img src="resources/images/stars_{rating}.png"/>',
        '<br><br>',
        '<img src="{snippet_image_url}" style="float: left;margin: 2px 2px 0 0; height: 40px"/>{snippet_text}'
    ]

});</pre>

It's the same code as before, with the addition of a +tpl+. The template will show the business name, address, rating
etc.

??Pass data to the template

Edit `modern/src/view/main/MainController.js` and replace the +onBusinessSelect+ method with this code:

    onBusinessSelect: function(business) {
        if (business) {
            this.getView().push({
                xtype: 'businessdetail',
                data: business.data,
                title: 'Business Detail'
            });
        }
    }

It's the same as before, but with the addition of setting the detail page's +data+ property to the
record's data. This means that any field in the record is available to the template. The code also
sets the title to the name of the business.

Save and refresh. Then select a business. You should see the template being used!
