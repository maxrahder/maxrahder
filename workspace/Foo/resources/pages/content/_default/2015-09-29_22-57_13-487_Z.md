Some of the code describes the data. 

    model: 'Ext.data.Model',
    fields: [{
        name: 'timestamp',
        convert: function(timestamp) {
            return new Date(timestamp);
        }
    }],

The config says that the store holds instances of +Ext.data.Model+, which is the base class
for any record definition.

It says that one of the fields in the feed needs to be converted from the value from the feed &mdash;
in this case, a UNIX timestamp &mdash; to another object, a JavaScript date.

Just like with the store, you could code your own +Ext.data.Model+ subclass and use that instead.
