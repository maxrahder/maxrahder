Jasmine's +beforeEach()+ and +afterEach()+ methods are ways of running code before or after each spec is run
There are also +beforeAll()+ and +afterAll()+ methods.

These methods are analogous to the +@Before+, +@After+, +@BeforeClass+ and +@AfterCLass+ annotations used in Java and .NET.

These constructs are commonly used in tests.
