When copying and pasting code, remember that each property is comma-separated.
<pre class="runnable 450">var o;

// This won't parse because there's no comma after the first property.
o = {
    a: 1
    b: [6, 7, 9]
};

// This is good
o = {
    a: 1,
    b: [6, 7, 9]
};

// This has an extra comma, which may cause a problem with some parsers.
// So the trailing comma is un-cool.
o = {
    a: 1,
    b: [6, 7, 9],
};


</pre>
