#Introduction

The previous lab had us create the *Salesperson Pivot Grid* with a default view. The true power of the Pivot Grid
is *pivoting* the data into multiple views.

In this lab, you will add a drop-down, allowing the user to select how they wish to view the data.

The following *psuedo-code* will allow us to pivot the data when the user selects to
pivot the data --

  * Listen to the combobox change event.
  * Determine the new combobox selection value.
  * Configure the grid to display the data based on the selection.

Let's get started!

??Add a sticky combobox

All panels have a special property +tbar+ which allows us to make a sticky toolbar at the top. For our dynamic pivot grid,
let's dock a combobox to the top of the panel.

Let's go ahead and add the definition of our +tbar+ to app/view/main/Main.js.

    tbar: [{
        xtype: 'combo',
        itemId: 'idSelect',
        fieldLabel: 'Select report',
        editable: false,
        flex: 1,
        value: 'r1',
        store: [
            ['r1', 'What are the order amounts of each salesperson?'],
            ['r2', 'What are the order amounts of each salesperson in a specific country?'],
            ['r3', 'How did salespeople perform in a specific year?']
        ]
    }],


Save and refresh the application. A combo box should now be docked at the top.

??Listen to the combobox for new selection value.

In the combobox definition, add a +listeners+ config object. Listen to the +change+ event.
For now, we will output a console.log statement to verify the listener is working correctly.

    listeners: {
        change: function(combo, newValue, oldValue, eOpts) {
            console.log('Selection detected');
        }
    }

Save and refresh the application. With the Debugger Console open, make a selection. You should see the
console.log output.

One of the returned values of a combobox change, is the *newValue*. Replace the previous console.log call
with the following.

    console.log(newValue);

Save, refresh your application and test. You should see the *newValue* being returned as you toggle the selection.

NOTE: Choosing the same selection twice, will NOT fire the +change+ event.

??Reconfigure the pivot grid view

For the sake of brevity, the following code is provided to show reconfiguring the pivot grid. Replace the previous
+change+ listener definition with the following code:


    change: function(combo, newValue, oldValue, eOpts) {
        var pivotgrid = combo.up('pivotgrid');
        switch (newValue) {
            case 'r1':
                pivotgrid.reconfigurePivot({
                    topAxis: []
                });
                break;
            case 'r2':
                pivotgrid.reconfigurePivot({
                    topAxis: [{
                        dataIndex: 'country',
                        direction: 'ASC'
                    }]
                });
                break;
            case 'r3':
                pivotgrid.reconfigurePivot({
                    topAxis: [{
                        dataIndex: 'year',
                       direction: 'ASC'
                    }]
                });
                break;
        }
    }

Save, refresh, and test. Your Salesperson Pivot Grid will now pivot the data by making a new selection in the combobox. 
Kudos, you are on your way to becoming a Pivot Grid Guru! ;)
