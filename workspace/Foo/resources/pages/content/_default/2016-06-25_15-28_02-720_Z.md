 Futures calls are a sequence of up to four types of methods: 

1. The component or element selector
1. Actions
1. Calls that wait for the component to be in a certain state
1. An +and+ function used to inspect the component or to run expectations


<pre class="runnable readonly 150">
ST.element('#mybutton'). // 1. A selector 
    click(10, 10).       // 2. An action -- click the button
    disabled().          // 3. Wait for the button to be disabled
    and(function (b) {   // 4. Run expectations on the button
        expect(button.hasCls('x-fa fa-foo')).toBe(true);
});
</pre>

There are many actions, and many waits, such as +collapse()+ and +collapsed()+ for panels, 
and +focus()+ and +focused()+ for form fields.
