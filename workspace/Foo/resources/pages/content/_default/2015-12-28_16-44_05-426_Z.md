Guidelines for topics and labs.

##Topics

- At the end of each topic include a slide of review questions.

##Labs

- The instructor should either show the ending solution, or show the final Yelp solution, highlighting what will be done in that lab

**Problem**: Students may miss a lab, and therefore, need a starting point for a given lab

**Solution**: Every lab has a zip of the finished app. To use that as a starting point:
- Rename the app folder &mdash; e.g., rename `yelpexplorer` to `yelpextplorer_save` 
- Unzip in the workspace
- Do a `sencha app build development` on the app
- Run the app to verify that it works
- If the saved copy is no longer needed, delete it

**Problem**: Students may get stuck

The student may get stuck, perhaps for some minor reason, and want to move on without caring about fully diagnosing the problem.

**Solution**: This is the same as the "miss a lab" problem &mdash; just use the solution.
