If you try to build an application that was originally created with an older version of Cmd,
you get the error:

    The application was last modified by an older version of Sencha Cmd
    The current version is ...
    Please run "sencha app upgrade" to update ...

Fix this by upgrading the application via:

    sencha app upgrade
