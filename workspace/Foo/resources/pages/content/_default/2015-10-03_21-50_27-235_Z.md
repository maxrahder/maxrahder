#Introduction

In this lab, you'll add a marker to the map that indicates the position of the International Space Station.

??Obtain the marker image

The marker code shows an image. You'll need to download the image and place it in your project's `resources/` folder.

Under the `iss` project folder, create a folder named `resources`. Right click on the image below, 
choose Save Image as... and save the file to `resources/iss.png`. 

<img src="resources/images/iss/iss.png"/>


??Add a method to plot the marker

Edit `app/view/Map.js` and add a +setCoordinate(coordinate)+. i.e., add a property
whose name is +setCoordinate+ and whose value is a function with a single parameter, 
named *coordinate*. 

Here's the entire map class, with the method added. The code has a lot of explanatory comments.
The setter is a little unusual. Most setters change a single property, but this setter keeps
track of all previous values, in order to show the path of the ISS.

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('ISS.view.Map', {
    extend: 'Ext.Map',
    xtype: 'issmap',
    mapOptions: {
        zoom: 3
    },

    setCoordinate: function(coordinate) {
    
        // "coordinate" is the current location of the ISS.
    
        // All the local vars are defined at the top of the method. Why? 
        // First, understand that a JavaScript local variable is scoped 
        // to the entire method. So no matter where you define a variable, 
        // it's as if you had defined them at the top. By why actually 
        // code them at the top? Because the "var" in a variable statement 
        // cannot be minimized, so if you're really really concerned about 
        // the minimized size of your application, then coding the variables as a 
        // single variable statement means saving three (yes 3) bytes per 
        // variable in the minimized code.
        var me = this,
            ll,
            polylineOptions,
            points,
            count,
            marker,
            i,
            map = me.getMap();
            
        // Bail out if no coordinate was passed.
        if (!coordinate) {
            return;
        }

        // This use of the logical "or" is a JavaScript idiom -- if the left 
        // side of the expression is "truthy" (and has a value), then use that 
        // value and do not evaluate the right side of the expression. If the 
        // left side is "falsey" (like "undefined"), then use the right side. 
        // In other words, the code acts like a lazy initializer, initializing 
        // the property to an empty array, or using the previously-created array. 
        // Over time, as pushCoordinate() is run, the array of coordinates will 
        // grow, showing the path of the ISS.
        me.coordinates = me.coordinates || [];
        
        // "push()" is an array method, that, uh, pushes a value onto the array.
        me.coordinates.push(coordinate);

        // Google uses a LatLng object to wrap up a latitude and longitude.
        ll = new google.maps.LatLng(coordinate.latitude, coordinate.longitude);
        me.setMapCenter(ll);

        points = [];
        count = me.coordinates.length;
        // Populate an array of LatLng objects, one for each previous ISS location.
        for (i = 0; i < me.coordinates.length; i++) {
            points.push(new google.maps.LatLng(me.coordinates[i].latitude, me.coordinates[i].longitude));
        }
        if (me.polyline) {
            // Garbage collect the old set of line coordinates.
            me.polyline.setMap(null); 
        }
        // Redraw the line from all ISS coordinates.
        me.polyline = new google.maps.Polyline({
            path: points,
            geodesic: true,
            strokeColor: '#0000FF',
            strokeOpacity: 0.1,
            strokeWeight: 4,
            map: map
        });

        // Lazily create the marker using a png in the resources folder.
        me.marker = me.marker || new google.maps.Marker({
            map: this.getMap(),
            icon: {
                url: 'resources/iss.png',
                anchor: new google.maps.Point(32, 32)
            }
        });
        me.marker.setPosition(ll);
        
        // This comment doesn't serve any purpose.
    }
});

// Neither does this one.  ;-)

</pre>

??Test the method

Save your work and refresh your web browser. 

Open the debugger console and get a reference to the *ISS.view.Map* object via:

    var map = Ext.first('issmap');

Try out the method by passing in a location:

    map.setCoordinate({latitude:46.809076,longitude:-100.7670546});

You should see the ISS marker appear somewhere over North Dakota.
