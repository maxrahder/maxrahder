#Introduction

In this lab, we will define the business model and 
businesses store, and show the results on the map.


#Steps

??Define the business model
 
You need to define a model for the businesses feed, 
which<a href="http://traininglabs.sencha.com/api/yelp/v2/search/?term=laundry&ll=33.6751155,-95.5316914" target="lab">looks like this</a>.

Note that the array of record data is in a property called +businesses+. 
This is specified by the reader's +rootProperty+.

Each datum is in the format we want, so we can use +type:'auto'+ for every field. 
The location (latitude and longitude) of a business is nested, so you need to use 
+mapping+ to specify the location.

Create the file `app/model/Business.js`. Code the class using this starter code:

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.model.Business', {
        extend: 'Ext.data.Model',
        
        proxy: {}
        
    });

Use this proxy:

    proxy: {
        type: 'ajax',
        url: 'http://traininglabs.sencha.com/api/yelp/v2/search/',
        reader: {
            type: 'json',
            rootProperty: 'businesses'
        }
    }

??Define the businesses store
 
Edit `app/view/main/MainModel.js` and add a stores config for schools, coded like this:

    stores: {
        businesses: { 
            model: 'YelpExtplorer.model.Business',
            pageSize: 20 // Yelp limits results to 20 at a time
        }
    }

 
This code results in the store being populated with *YelpExtplorer.model.Business* instances. 
As usual, when a class creates an object, the object's class needs to be loaded. Therefore, you 
need to add +requires:['YelpExtplorer.model.Business']+ to the view model class definition.

When you are finished, the view model should look like this:
<pre class="runnable readonly 380">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.ViewModel',
    alias: 'viewmodel.main',

    requires: ['YelpExtplorer.model.Business'],

    data: {
        location: {latitude: 46.809076, longitude: -100.7670546} // Bismark, ND
    },
    stores: {
        businesses: {
            model: 'YelpExtplorer.model.Business',
            pageSize: 20 // Yelp limits results to 20 at a time
        }
    }

});</pre>

??Load the store

The store needs to be loaded with data whenever the location changes. Do do that, edit
`app/view/main/MainController.js` and add this method:

    load: function() {
        var vm = this.getViewModel();
        var location = vm.get('location');
        // This only loads the store if location is present.
        if (!location) return;
        var store = vm.getStore('businesses');
        var params = {
            ll: (location.latitude + ',' + location.longitude)
        };
        store.load({
            params: params
        });
    }

The method gets a local reference to the view model. If the location has been established,
it then runs +load()+ on the businesses store, passing the *ll* parameter used by the Yelp
server &mdash; it returns 20 businesses around that location.

You want the method to be run as the location changes. Therefore, modify the +initViewModel+ method like this:

    initViewModel: function(vm) {

        var me = this;

        vm.bind('{city}', Ext.Function.createBuffered(me.geocodeCity, 1000, me));
        vm.bind('{location}', me.load, me);

    }

This binding for location isn't buffered, because setting location is already buffered as the user types the city.

If you save and refresh, you won't see anything in the user interface yet, because you haven't
wired the map to the store. However, if you look at network traffic you should see the call to
fetch the data. If you type this in the debugger console you should get 20 &mdash; the number
of businesses returned by Yelp

    Ext.first('app-main').getViewModel().getStore('businesses').getCount();


??Bind the businesses store to the map

Edit the tab panel view, and code the map config to have its +store+ bound to the businesses store. 

    {
        title: 'Map',
        xtype: 'businessesmap',
        bind: {
            location: '{location}',
            store: '{businesses}'
        }
    }


Save and refresh the browser window. You should see markers on the map for the initial location hard-coded
in the main view model. If you type a city, and wait a second, you should see the map center on that location
and markers.

??Select a default city

Rather than a default location, it might be more logical to have a default city.

Edit `app/view/main/MainModel.js` and remove the location from the data section, and instead, add
a *city*. Do something like this:

    data: {
        city: 'Redwood City, CA'
    }

If you save your changes, and refresh the brower, you should see the map centered on the city, with map
markers.

Note that there was still a one second delay, which doesn't really make sense in this case. We'll fix
that in another lab. 

??Add category to the Yelp request

You need to add the code that lets the user send category information to Yelp.

First, replace the view controller's  +loadBusinesses+ method with this:

    load: function() {
        var vm = this.getViewModel();
        var location = vm.get('location');
        var category = vm.get('category');
        // This only loads the store if both location and category are present.
        if (!(location && category)) return;
        var store = vm.getStore('businesses');
        var params = {
            ll: (location.latitude + ',' + location.longitude)
        };
        if (category) {
            params.term = category;
        }
        store.load({
            params: params
        });
        vm.set('business', null);
    }
    
It's just like you had before, but it also includes category in the query. 

Then do the following things. Each is done the same way they were done for city, so you should be able to figure 
out the details on your own. (Remember, if you get stuck you can take a peek at the 
lab solution.)

- Edit `classic/src/view/businesses/Filter.js`
    - Put a *reference* on the category text field
    - Code an +updateCategory+ method
    - Put a *change* listener on the category text field


- Edit `classic/src/view/main/Main.js` and bind the filter toolbar's +category+ to *category*


- Edit `app/view/main/MainModel.js` and hard-code an initial value for +category+, such as *coffee*


- Edit `app/view/main/MainController.js` and in the +initViewModel+ method and bind a buffered function to *{category}* using this code:


    vm.bind('{category}', Ext.Function.createBuffered(me.load, 1000, me));


When you're finished, you'll see your initial city and category being reflected on the map. If you type a city
or category, you'll see the results on the map.




# Conclusion

You've created a *Business* model class, and a *businesses* store in the view model. The store
is loaded whenever the location changes. The location changes whenever the city changes. The map
is bound to *{location}*, which automatically runs +setLocation()+ whenever the view model property 
changes. The map is also bound to *{businesses}* &mdash; the map shows markers for the businesses
whenever the map is loaded.
