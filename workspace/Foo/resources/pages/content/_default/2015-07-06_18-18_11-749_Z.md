# Introduction

Let's adjust our application theme to brand it according to the styleguide for our customers.

Furthermore, you'll also include the viewport styling in the application's built CSS, rather 
than having it in a separate file referenced in `index.html`.

#Steps

??Stop using the stylesheet
 
Rename `yelpextplorer/resources/stylesheet.css` to `stylesheet_save.css`.

Remove this reference from `app.json`: 
<pre>
{
    "path": "resources/stylesheet.css",
    "bootstrap": false
}</pre>
  
As always, after editing `app.json` you
need to run `sencha app refresh` in a terminal window.

Refresh your application to verify that the old stylesheet styling is no
longer in effect &mdash; the View tab should be unstyled.

??Move the stylesheet information into Sass and build the application

Create the file `sass/src/view/businesses/View.scss`. Then open `yelpextplorer/resources/stylesheet_save.css` 
and copy and paste its contents into the new file. Save your changes.

Since we're changing styling, we need to re-build the application. In the terminal
window, from the project folder, enter:
<pre>sencha app build development</pre>

Wait for the build to finish running, then refresh your browser window. You should see the styles back 
in effect.

Sometimes Chrome caches CSS more than it should. If you don't see the new styles in effect, try doing 
an *Empty Cache and Hard Reload* by right-clicking on the reload button in Chrome, and choosing that option.

Note the location of the Sass file &mdash; it's in a file whose path and name matches the
location of the businesses view class. Sass files are only processed if their paths and names 
match app source file paths and names. Since the styling relates to the businesses view, 
it's an intuitive place to put the Sass styling. But keep in mind that wherever the Sass file is
placed, the styling is still global. In other words, the contents of the Sass file could have been 
placed in another location, such as `sass/Application.scss`, and it would have accomplished the 
same thing.


??Brand your application by setting the base color

Let's brand the application and change the color variables.
Create a new file `sass/var/Application.scss`
Make sure you create the file in the `var` directory.

Set the base color to red by adding:
+$base-color: red;+

Save your changes and re-run +sencha app build development+. When it's finished, refresh your browser window. 
You can see the red color affecting the theme by looking at the tabs and the mouseover on the tabs.

Use the following variables, and set these to a HEX color or color name of choice
For example +#cc0000+ (light red), +#ff0000+ (pure red), and +#ffffff+ (pure white).

Try out some of these variables:
- +$button-default-base-color+
- +$button-default-color+
- +$panel-base-color+
- +$panel-header-color+
 

There is another way of applying styling changes: +sencha app watch+. That's a process that monitors
changes to source code or Sass files, and incrementally builds the application automatically. If you need
to make lots of styling changes, and to see the effect as you go, +sencha app watch+ is handier than re-building 
as you make changes. You'll try that out later in this lab.


??Add a Save button style
 
The project's usability expert has decreed that all Save buttons have their 
own look and feel so they're easier to recognize by users. *To wit*, every
Save button should have a green background.
 
Open the <a href="classicAPI/#!/api/Ext.button.Button-css_mixin-extjs-button-ui" target="api">API documentation 
CSS mixins section for Ext.button.Button</a>. There are several sets of named styles that you can include and 
modify as needed. 

To do this, create the file `sass/src/Application.scss` and add this code. 
Make sure you create the file in the `src` folder, and not the `var` folder.
 <pre>
 @include extjs-button-small-ui(
     $ui: 'save',	
     $background-color: green
 );
</pre>
 
This code creates a set of styling that can be used with small-scaled buttons.
Any small-scaled button with +ui:'save'+ will use the styling.
 
Note that this is an unrealistically simple example. In practice we'd need to 
style the borders, styling for when the component is disabled, when the user 
mouses over, when the button is pressed, etc.
 
Save your changes and re-run +sencha app build development+. 

To use the new button style, edit `app/view/business/edit/Window.js` and add +ui:'save'+ to the Save button's
config. Save and refresh the browser. Then open the edit window and you should see that the Save button has a 
green background.


??Stop the server

In a terminal window type +sencha web stop+.

We'll be using Fashion to compile the application's CSS, which needs special server setup.
You'll do that in the next lab step.


??Start Sencha Cmd *watch*

Navigate to the `labs/yelpextplorer` folder and enter
    
    sencha app watch

After doing an initial build, Watch will keep running as it waits for changes &mdash; 
look for the message +[INF] Waiting for changes...+ in the terminal window. Changes
are automatically detected &mdash; as you edit `.scss` or `.js` files, Watch will 
do partial builds.

??Start Fashion

Use your web browser to run the starter app, using a special URL:

<a href="http://localhost:1841/yelpextplorer?platformTags=fashion:true" target="lab">http://localhost:1841/yelpextplorer?platformTags=fashion:true</a>

Note the `?platformTags=fashion:true` appended to the url. This starts Fashion.

The application launches more slowly than usual because Fashion is reading all the SCSS. You can see this
by using the debugger to filter network traffic on *scss*.

With the `?platformTags=fashion:true` parameter, Fashion will also rebuild the CSS *in the browser*.
This is possible because Fashion is written in JavaScript, so it can be run by the browser itself, 
and the results are live.


??Change a Sass variable

Edit `sass/var/Application.scss`. Without saving, change the base color to
something new:

    $base-color: fuchsia;

Then, while looking at the running app in your Web browser, save `Application.scss` &mdash; after
a moment, the app should reflect the new base color.

??Make another change to the SCSS file

In the running application, select a business then in the detail panel click Edit.

With the window still visible, edit `scss/var/Application.scss` and change the base color
to a new value:

    $base-color: green;

Save, and then look at the running app. After a moment, it will reflect the new base color. 

<img src="resources/images/yelp/YelpWindowBaseColorGreen.jpg"/>

The significance is that you can style your app *as it runs*, thus making styling more focused and quicker.

??Stop Sencha Cmd *watch*

In the terminal window in which  +sencha app watch+ is running, press Ctrl-c to stop it. Then open a new terminal 
window, navigate to `SenchaTraining`, and enter +sencha web start+.

#Conclusion

You compiled-in the dataview styling, changed some Sass variables and added a custom mixin.

You also saw how Fashion speeds up the development process by allowing you to see styling changes
in a running application.
