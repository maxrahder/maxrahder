Tests can be run from the command line using Sencha Test Command-line (STC).

This lets you run tests as part of your build process or your continuous integration system.

STC uses Selenium WebDriver to manage browsers. You can also run tests using a
cloud-based browser farm, such as Sauce Labs or BrowserStack.

Test results are captured by STC and saved to the Sencha Test Archiver. Using Sencha Studio, 
archived test results can be reviewed using the same graphical format as the interactive test runner.
