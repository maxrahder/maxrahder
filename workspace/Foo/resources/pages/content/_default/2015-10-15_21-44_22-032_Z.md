#Introduction

In this lab, you'll finish the form. It's the second item in the carousel. 

The form will have a text field showing the location. This allows the user
to type a specific city to see if umbrellas are needed there. 

There's also a *Use Current Location* button, used to reset the location back to the current
location. 

And there's a check box, used to indicate whether it's rainy. The user can manually
set that in case the forecast says it's not raining, but it actually is. 

??Change the view class

Edit `modern/src/view/Location.js` and change the class definition to +extend:'Ext.form.Panel'+

Remove the +html+ config entirely. And give the form panel +padding:16+.

When you are finished the class should look like this:

<pre class="runnable readonly 240">
Ext.define('Umbrella.view.Location', {
    extend: 'Ext.form.Panel',
    xtype: 'location',
    requires: [],
    padding: 16,
    items: []
});
</pre>

??Add the city field

Add a text field config to the +items+ array.

    {
        xtype: 'textfield',
        label: 'City'
    }
    
As usual, since you're using some new class, you need to require it. Add +Ext.field.Text+ 
to the +requires+ array.

??Think about binding it to reflect the city

It's tempting to bind the field to *{city}*. But the problem is, the latitude and longitude
are recalculated whenever *{city}* changes. If you were to bind it, and started typing, 
the geocoding would happen *as the user is typing!*

The solution is to have two fields. One to hold the actual city being used for the geocoding, 
and another used for the city displayed to the user on the form. 

??Bind a display city

Add the binding to the textfield item. 

    bind: {
        value: '{displayCity}'
    }

This will result in the typed value being pushed to a view model property named *displayCity*.

??React to the *displayCity* being changed

Edit `app/view/main/BaseController.js` and edit +initViewModel+ to add a binding to detect changes to the displayed value.
The statement can be anywhere in the method.

    vm.bind('{displayCity}', function(city) {
        console.log(city);
    });

If you save and refresh, then type something in the field, you'll see the value logged as you type.

??Add a buffered function

Ext JS has an +Ext.Function+ singleton that has some function-related utility functions.
One of them is +Ext.Function.createBuffered()+. A buffered function can only be run once
within a specified amount of time.

Replace the binding from the last step with a new version that uses a buffered function.

    vm.bind('{displayCity}', Ext.Function.createBuffered(function(city) {
        console.log(city);
    }, 1000));

Save and refresh, then type. When you stop typing, after a one second delay, the +console.log()+ is run.

Now edit the statement again, and instead of logging the city, set the *{city}* in the view model.

    vm.bind('{displayCity}', Ext.Function.createBuffered(function(city) {
        vm.set('city', city);
    }, 1000));

Test the code by saving and refreshing. Then, use the form field to enter a city name. Wait a moment, then
run this on the debugger console:

    Ext.first('main').getViewModel().getData();
    
You should see the city you entered in the view model.

??Initialize the display value

You also need the city field to reflect the initial city &mdash; either the hard-coded value or the
one determined by using the user's location.

Edit `app/view/main/BaseController.js` and edit +initViewModel+ to add a statement to the binding on *{city}*.

    vm.bind('{city}', function(city) {
        vm.set('displayCity', city);
        Umbrella.util.Geocode.determineLocation(city).then(function(ll) {
            vm.set('location', ll);
        });
    });

Save and refresh, and you should see your initial city in the text field. 

??Add the other items

Edit `modern/src/view/Location.js` and add a few more items to the +items+ array:

- The *Use Current Location* button
- A component used to separate the button from the checkbox
- The *Rainy* checkbox

To center everything, you should specify the form's +layout+ as +type:'vbox'+ and +pack:'center'+.

Here's the code:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('Umbrella.view.Location', {
    extend: 'Ext.form.Panel',
    xtype: 'location',
    requires: ['Ext.field.Text', 'Ext.field.Checkbox', 'Ext.Component', 'Ext.Button'],
    padding: 16,
    layout: {
        type: 'vbox',
        pack: 'center'
    },
    items: [{
        xtype: 'textfield',
        label: 'City',
        bind: {
            value: '{displayCity}'
        }
    }, {
        xtype: 'button',
        text: 'Use Current Location'
    }, {
        xtype: 'component',
        height: 24
    }, {
        xtype: 'checkboxfield',
        label: 'Rainy'
    }]
});
</pre>

??Bind the checkbox

Edit `modern/src/view/Location.js` and modify the checkbox config to bind it as
+checked:'{rainy}'+

Save and refresh. The initial value of the umbrella should match the checkbox.
And if you change the checkbox setting, the umbrella image should change!

??Set the current location

Continue to edit `modern/src/view/Location.js` and modify the button config
with +handler:'onUseCurrentLocation'+. 


    {
        xtype: 'button',
        text: 'Use Current Location',
        handler: 'onUseCurrentLocation'
    }

The +handler+ config is convenience syntax that lets you set the *tap* event
to a handler.

Now, edit `modern/src/view/main/MainController.js` and add the +onUseCurrentLocation+
method &mdash; have it run +this.useCurrentLocation()+. The controller *extends* the
base controller, so this call simply runs the ancestor method.

<pre class="runnable readonly 300">
Ext.define('Umbrella.view.main.MainController', {
    extend: 'Umbrella.view.main.BaseController',
    alias: 'controller.main-main',
    requires: [],

    initViewModel: function(vm) {
        this.callParent(arguments);
    },
    onUseCurrentLocation: function(button) {
        this.useCurrentLocation();
    }

});
</pre>

To test it, save, refresh, then enter some city. Wait a moment, then press
*Use Current Location* and wait a moment &mdash; the city field should change
to the name of your city.
