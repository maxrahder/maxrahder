The *Dark Sky Forecast API* is pretty easy to use. You register, get an API key, and you're set.

There's basically a single forecast call, which requires an API key, and latitude and longitude.

The response has four key sections:

- Current conditions
- Minute-by-minute forecast for the next hour (60 items)
- Hourly data for the next two days (48 items)
- Daily data for the next week (7 items)

There is only one type of response object, although it's sparse &mdash; depending on the source
of data, some forecasts have more data and more properties in the response.
