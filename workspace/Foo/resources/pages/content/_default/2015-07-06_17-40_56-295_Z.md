= What's Actually Happening in Dev Mode?

In Ext JS, you will work with Sass files, (Dynamic StyleSheets), these Sass files will be compiled to CSS files
when building your application with Sencha Cmd. 
The CSS is what your browser understands. Within Sencha Ext JS, the actual CSS file only lives in your build folder.

The `bootstrap.css` file, is a StyleSheet generated by Sencha Cmd.
It imports the most recent CSS build from the `build/resources` directory. 
@imports in CSS is an additional page request but since we are on localhost that doesnâ€™t matter.
