If you think charts are cool, you'll probably enjoy reading Darrell Huff's 1954 book 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_lie_with_statistics" target="_blank">How to Lie with Statistics</a>, which has sold over 1.5 million copies.

You'll probably also enjoy, Edward Tufte's 
<a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi" target="_blank">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> &mdash; a seminal work that discusses how to clearly and succinctly present information using charts.
Tufte has published other books relating to visualizing information.

One of Tufte's favorite graphs was created by the French civil engineer, Charles Minard, in 1869.
It depicts Napolean's Moscow campaign, 1812 to 1813. The chart shows the size and location of the army over time.
The width of the bar represents the size of the army. The colored bar is the army going toward Moscow, and the
black bar is the army returning. Temperature is at the bottom.


Note, for example, the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Berezina" target="_blank">battle at the crossing of river Berezina</a>, where about half of Napolean's already vastly depleted force of 50,000 was lost.
