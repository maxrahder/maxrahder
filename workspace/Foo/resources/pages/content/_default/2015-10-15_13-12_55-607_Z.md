Which method is better for you depends on several factors:

- You do (or do not) want to change any code in your application
- The app is (or is not) being hosted locally by Sencha Cmd
- You are inspecting a **deployed app that may be remote**
- You are inspecting an app on your **local machine that you are currently developing**
