WARNING: When coding universal applications, run +sencha app refresh+
whenever you create, rename, move or delete a source file. The refresh 
causes the microloader to determine source file locations. Universal
apps are trickier than previous apps, because a given class may have its source
in either the toolkit folder or in the shared `app` folder.
