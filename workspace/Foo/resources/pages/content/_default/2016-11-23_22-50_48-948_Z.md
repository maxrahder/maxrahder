Jasmine comes with lots of built-in matchers. But you can create and use your own matchers too. 
If your tests frequently check certain sequences of matchers, you can use a custom matcher to 
encapsulate the test.

Custom matchers are set up using a factory, usually coded in the +beforeEach+. 
Thus, the matchers are available in any spec in the suite, and are torn-down
automatically after each spec is run.
