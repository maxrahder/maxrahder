To update a Touch app, you simply generate a modern starter app of the same name, and copy
over the `app` folder (and `sass`, if needed). 

Entries in `app.json` may need to be manually re-edited.

As an alternative, you can create a universal app and move the old `app` folder contents to 
`modern/src`.
