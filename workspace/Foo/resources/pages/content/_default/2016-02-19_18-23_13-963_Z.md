<div type="expander" caption="Do an <i>app refresh</i> whenever you edit <kbd>app.json</kbd>">

A +sencha app refresh+ generates a new `boostrap.js` based on `app.json`.
Any time you edit `app.json` you need to do an app refresh.

</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Do an <i>app build</i> when you change or include Sass">

<p>
A +sencha app build development+ does an +app refresh+, and in addition it
processes Sass and creates the CSS used by the app.
</p>
<p>
Therefore, you only need to do a `sencha app build development` *when
you make a change that ultimately affects the generated CSS*:
<ul>
<li>You edit your Sass
<li>You change the app theme in <kbd>app.json</kbd>
<li>You edit a Sass package you're using
<li>You require a code package that has its own Sass
</ul>
</p>
</div>
