#Introduction

In this lab you'll code a form used to edit a business.

#Steps

??Review the requirements

The UI design calls for an Edit button on the bottom of the detail page.
When clicked, the edit page slides into view.

??Create the edit page

Create the file `modern/src/view/business/Edit.js` with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly 200">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.business.Edit', {
    extend: 'Ext.Container',
    xtype: 'businessedit',
    html: 'Business edit form'
});
</pre>

??Add the Edit button

Adding the Edit button will be a little awkward. It can't go in the list, because a list
only uses its +itemTpl+ for content. Modify the controller to nest the detail panel within 
a container, and put the button in the container.

Edit `modern/src/view/main/MainController.js` and replace the +pushOnce+ code with this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
pushOnce: function(business) {
    // Only push the detail page if it's not already there.
    if (business && !this.getView().down('businessdetail')) {
        this.getView().push({
            xtype: 'container',
            layout: 'fit',
            title: 'Business Details',
            items: [{
                xtype: 'businessdetail',
                reference: 'businessdetail',
                data: business.data
            }, {
                xtype: 'button',
                docked: 'bottom',
                text: 'Edit',
                handler: 'onEditClick'
            }]
        });
    }
}
</pre>

Save and refresh. Then select a business from either the map or list, and you should see the detail
page with a button across the bottom.

??Show the form

Look at the +pushOnce+ method and notice that the Edit button has a handler. Add that as a method
in `modern/src/view/main/MainController.js`:



    onEditClick: function(button) {
        console.log('onEditClick');
    }

Save and refresh. Select a business, then click on Edit. You should see the console message.

Continue to edit `modern/src/view/main/MainController.js` and have the +onEditClick+ method push the edit
page onto the navigation view. The code also passes the record to the form's view model &mdash; that will 
make it easier to bind fields to the view model.

    onEditClick: function(button) {
        this.getView().push({
            xtype: 'businessedit',
            viewModel: {
                data: {
                    business: this.getViewModel().get('business')
                }
            },
            edit: true, // To flag it when popping
            title: 'Edit Business'
        });
    }



And you'll need to add +'YelpExtplorer.view.business.Edit'+ to the controller's +requires+ array.

??Enhance the form

Edit `modern/src/view/business/Edit.js` and have it extend +Ext.form.Panel+, and add a field, bound to the
business name.

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.business.Edit', {
    extend: 'Ext.form.Panel',
    xtype: 'businessedit',

    bodyPadding: 8,
    layout: {
        type: 'vbox'
    },
    items: [{
        xtype: 'component',
        height: 20
    }, {
        xtype: 'textfield',
        label: 'Name',
        bind: {
            value: '{business.name}'
        }
    }, {
        xtype: 'component',
        height: 20
    }, {
        xtype: 'togglefield',
        label: 'Closed',
        bind: {
            value: '{business.is_closed}'
        }
    }, {
        xtype: 'component',
        height: 20
    }, {
        xtype: 'urlfield',
        label: 'URL',
        bind: {
            value: '{business.url}'
        }
    }]

});</pre>

Note that the form now holds a *textfield*, a *togglefield* and a *urlfield*. There are also empty components between
them to make things more spaced out.

Save and refresh. Then go to the List tab, select a business, and press Edit. Change the name and press Back. Note that the name on the
detail page does *not* change. Press back again and look at the business name on the list &mdash; that name *has* changed.

Why? Components with a *store* property are usually smart enough to listen to data change events, and update themselves
accordingly. But the detail page simply sets the data as it's created. 

??Update things as the user presses back

Edit `modern/src/view/main/Main.js` and add a listener for the *pop* event. That event is fired as the user presses
Back and the card is popped off the navigation view's stack.

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.Main', {
    extend: 'Ext.navigation.View',
    xtype: 'app-main',
    requires: [
        'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainController',
        'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel',
        'YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.TabPanel',
        'YelpExtplorer.view.businesses.Filter'
    ],

    controller: 'main-main',
    viewModel: {
        type: 'main-main'
    },

    listeners: {
        pop: 'onPop'
    },


    items: [{
        title: 'YelpExtplorer',
        layout: 'fit',
        xtype: 'container',
        items: [{
            xtype: 'businessesfilter',
            docked: 'top'
        }, {
            xtype: 'businessestabpanel'
        }]
    }]

});
</pre>

Then edit `modern/src/view/main/MainController.js` and add the +onPop+ method:

    onPop: function(view, card) {
        console.log('onPop');
    }

Save and refresh. Select a business, then press Back. You should see the log message.
Select a business, click on Edit, then press Back. You should see the log message again.

Now replace the +onPop+ code with code that updates the detail page:

    onPop: function(view, card) {
        if (card.edit) {
            var business = this.getViewModel().get('business');
            this.lookupReference('businessdetail').setData(business.data);
        }
    }


??Optional: Let the user un-do changes

As the user edits, the record is updated immediately. But what if the user makes a mistake? There should
be a way to reset the data to the original values. You can do that with two +Ext.data.Model+ methods &mdash;
+commit()+ and +reject()+.

Edit `modern/src/view/business/Edit.js` and add a new item to the +items:[]+:

    {
        xtype: 'toolbar',
        docked: 'bottom',
        items: [{
            text: 'Reset',
            handler: 'onResetClick'
        }]
    }

Since the code creates a toolbar, you need to require +Ext.Toolbar+.

Now edit `modern/src/view/main/MainController.js` and add an +onResetClick+ method:

    onResetClick: function(button) {
        var business = this.getViewModel().get('business');
        business.reject();
    }

The +reject()+ method sets the values to their original values. But what if the user edited some values,
pressed back, then re-edited and pressed Reset? In that case *all* changes would be reset, including the
earlier ones.

To avoid that you should *commit* values as the user presses Back, via +commit()+

Continue to edit `modern/src/view/main/MainController.js` and add a +commit()+ in the +onPop+ method:

    onPop: function(view, card) {
        if (card.edit) {
            var business = this.getViewModel().get('business');
            business.commit();
            this.lookupReference('businessdetail').setData(business.data);
        }
    }

This means that every time the user presses back the data is committed to that state. That means that
a future call to +reject()+ will reflect the state of the data as of the last +commit()+.



#Conclusion

You've coded a form panel with a text field, a toggle field, and a URL field. You've also used +commit()+ and +reject()+
to update the record and roll-back changes.
