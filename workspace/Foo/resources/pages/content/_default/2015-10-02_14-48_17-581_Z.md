#Introduction
 
In this lab, you'll create a classic starter application and review its structure. A classic
app is structured like an Ext JS 5.x app.

#Steps

??Generate the starter application

In a terminal window, go to the `SenchaTraining/ext-6` folder and type this statement:

    sencha generate app -classic MyClassic ../labs/myclassic


??Run the application

Use your Web browser to visit the new application. You'll see the starter app,
styled using the *Triton* theme.

The Triton theme makes extensive use of the Font Awesome icon font. 

??Look at `app.js`

As usual, the +Ext.application()+ call is in `app.js`. Note that 
it's coded to extend +MyClassic.Application+. Extending a class
within your application allows you to override application 
settings within your own class definition.

??Look at `app/Application.js`

`app/Application.js` holds a class definition that extends +Ext.app.Application+, 
which lets you override various application settings. For example, you can 
use the +stores+ array to define global store instances.

You might also use `Application.js` to require custom field types or other
global code.

Note the +onAppUpdate+ method. It's used by the microloader to let the user know
that new code has been included in the application. 

??Look at `app/view/main/Main.js`

The main view is a tab panel that does a lot of fancy things with the tab bar and header. 
There's also some responsive code, and a lot of binding. 

Most of the tabs simply show *lorem ipsum* text, but the first tab is interesting because it
uses a grid, and that grid creates a store via an alias. 

Using a custom store class doesn't come up that often &mdash; this starter app uses a custom
class because, in the universal version of the starter app, the store class is shared between 
the classic and modern parts of the app.
