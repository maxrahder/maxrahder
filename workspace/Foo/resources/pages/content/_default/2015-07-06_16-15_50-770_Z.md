#Establishing The Range of The Axis

The range of values for an axis is the minimum and maximum shown on its scale. 

<div type="expander" caption="The Series Determine the Range" class="x-hidden">
If a series is plotted against an axis, the range of values in the series is used
to determine the axis minimum and maximum values. 
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="fields[]" class="x-hidden">
You may also use the +fields+ array to explicitly name fields in the data 
store. When used, the axis simply looks in the store at all the values for the 
specified fields, and sets the maximum and minimum values based on what it finds. 
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Explicitly Specifying the Range" class="x-hidden">
<p>Each axis type also provides a way to explicitly set the range of values:</p>
<ul>
<li>+minimum+ and +maximum+ for numeric and gauge axes</li>
<li>+dateFrom+ and +dateTo+ for a time axis</li>
<li>+categoryNames+ for a category axis</li>
<li>+maximum+ for a radial axis</li>
</ul>
<p>
These can be used in combination with +fields+, with the explicit value taking precedent.
