If you do a prodution build, `app.js` is cached by the browser. 

You can see this by doing a build, then visiting the production version of the app and 
looking at network traffic in the browser.

Initially it results in an HTTP status of 200, but on refresh it's a 304 (not modified), which means
the source hasn't changed so the browser uses a cached copy.

<small>(A +_dc+ param is still added, but it's a constant set to the build timestamp. This means
that a production build won't accidentally use a previous build.)</small>
