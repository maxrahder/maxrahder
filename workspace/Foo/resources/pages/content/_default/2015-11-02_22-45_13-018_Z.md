At run time there is a left hand side of an assignment &mdash; the *target*. And there is a 
right-hand side &mdash; the *source*.

<pre class="runnable 160 readonly">
var a = 1;
function foo(bar){
    var a = 1;
    var b = 2;
    c = 3;
}
foo();
</pre>

- In line 1 the target is *a*, and its scope was established to be global.
- Line 2 is a declaration, so it's ignored at run time
- In line 7, *foo* resolves to the function, and since it's a function it can be run via +foo()+
- As +foo()+ is run, the *a* in line 3 resolves to the foo-scoped variable *a*
- The *b* in line 4 resolves to the foo-scoped variable *b*
- The *c* in line assignment in line 5 resolves to the globally-scope variable *c*
