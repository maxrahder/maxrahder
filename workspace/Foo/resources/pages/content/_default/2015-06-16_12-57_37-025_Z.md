#Introduction

Let's try out some styling properties.

#Steps

??Review the code at the top of the page.

The code creates an instance of *Ext.Component*, with HTML content, 
rendered to the document body. 

Remember that the +renderTo+ property is useful for Live 
Preview, and coding little tests and examples, but isn't used in 
most production applications.

Press the preview button and you should see the words from the *html* 
property.

??Add styling so we can see the component

Add a *style* config, setting the style to
+style: { border: '1px dashed red'}+

After adding the style property your code should look like the following.
Remember to separate +name:value+ pairs with commas. The order of the 
config properties does not matter.

<pre>
Ext.create('Ext.Component', {
    html : 'This is my component',
    style : { border : '1px dashed red'},
    renderTo : Ext.getBody()
});
</pre>

??Try out the new styling

Press the preview button and you should see a red dashed border around 
the text. The border takes up all the width and only as much height as 
needed by the text. Most components render via a  <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.
Since div's are block elements, the component is taking up the full width
of the window.

??Creating components and setting *style* is unusual 

It's somewhat unusual to create an *Ext.Component*. Normally you create 
instances of component sub-classes, like panels and buttons. Furthermore, 
the *style* property is <u>very</u> rarely used since that type of styling 
should be via application styling. (Styling &mdash; or *theming* &mdash; is
covered at the end of class.)

We're just doing all this here because we haven't talked about other components yet, and because we're choosing to look at the style properties discussed in lecture.

??Set the component *width* and *height*

Edit the code and add properties for width and height. Set them to something like
100 and 100. Then press the preview button. You should see a 100 x 100 pixel red
dashed rectangle around the text.

??Set the margin

Edit the code and add a property specifying the margin as 32. We're making it a 
big margin to make it obvious. Try it out.

At this point your code should look something like this:

<pre>
Ext.create('Ext.Component', {
    html : 'This is my component',
    style : {border : '1px dashed red'},
    height: 100, 
    width: 100,
    margin: 32,
    renderTo : Ext.getBody()
});
</pre>

??Add padding

The *padding* property puts padding around a component's contents. 
Set the padding to 4. (That way it will be distinct from the margin.) 
Press the preview button and you'll see the text moved away from the 
edge of the border.

??Assign a CSS class

Set the *cls* property to assign CSS class *"coolborder"*. That style 
has already been defined for you as +1px solid blue+.

If you try it, you'll still see the dashed red border. Why? Because they both 
set the same property, but since the <code>style</code> sets an in-line style, 
it takes precedence over the named style.

Delete the *style*, press the preview button, and you should see the 
<*>coolborder* solid blue line.

??Try another cls-related property

Re-type the <code>cls</code> property with <code>overCls</code>. This 
specifies a class that is in effect as the user mouses over the component.

Your code should now look something like this:

<pre>
Ext.create('Ext.Component', {
    html : 'This is my component',
    height: 100, 
    width: 100,
    margin: 32,
    padding: 4,
    overCls: 'coolborder',
    renderTo : Ext.getBody()
 });
</pre>

Press the preview button and you'll see no borders, since the old blue border 
isn't in effect now. But if you move your mouse over the component you'll see 
the blue border appear.

??Change the class

Change your code to create an +Ext.Container+ rather than a component.

If you run it, it works the same! That's because a +Ext.Container+ extends +Ext.Component+ &mdash;
a container *is a* component. That's why it's good to understand base classes. Every property and
method in a base class is also available in sub-classes (although a given subclass may override them).





#Conclusion

You just saw some of the styling properties built into every component and 
component sub-class. All components have the ability to set height, width, 
padding, margins and do basic styling.
