The +ST+ library has an +ST.screenshot()+ function that lets you compare an automatically
generated screenshot of the viewport with a baseline screenshot.

</div>

When you run via `stc` you can specify the path to a specific baseline.

Within Studio, you can do an image comparison from the +Runs+ tab.
You can also mark a newly generated image as the new baseline.
