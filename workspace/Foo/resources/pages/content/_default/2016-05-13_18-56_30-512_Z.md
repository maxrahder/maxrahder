Writing tests is time consuming, but another problem is making sure
the app runs across all supported devices and operating systems:

| Browsers and versions | Devices | Operating Systems |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------ |
| Chrome<br>Firefox<br>Internet Explorer<br>Safari<br>Opera| Desktop<br>Tablet<br>Phone | Windows<br>OSX<br>UNIX<br>iOS<br>Android      |


Even supporting a modest number of combinations is too much to maintain without tools.
<table style="width:200px">
<tr><td></td><td>100 tests</td>
<tr><td>x</td><td>3 browsers</td>
<tr><td>x</td><td>3 versions</td>
<tr><td>x</td><td>4 operating systems</td>
<tr><td></td><td><hr/></td>
<tr><td></td><td>O_o</td>
</table>
