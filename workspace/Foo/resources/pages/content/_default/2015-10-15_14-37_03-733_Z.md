The first step is to configure your application so that it can connect to Sencha Inspector. To do this, open your app’s app.json file and locate the “js” array. Next, edit it to include following lines


    
    "js" : [
          ..//existing scripts
          {
               // Use your Machine Name
               "path" : "http://MyComputerName:1839/inspector.js",
               // Or Use your IP Address
               //"path" : "http://123.456.78.90:1839/inspector.js",
               "remote"    : true,
               "bootstrap" : true
          }
     ]

NOTE: We cannot use +http://local.senchainspector.com+ as our “path” when debugging applications running on remote devices. This is because http://local.senchainspector.com is simply an alias for localhost. Localhost always refers to the device on which the app is running and Sencha Inspector is not running on the remote device.

After adding this configuration to app.json, you also need to add initialization code to your app. Locate {appRoot}/app/Application.js and then modify it to include the launch() method’s logic as seen in the example below:


    //Do not modify entire Application.js - "DemoClient" is just an example name  
     Ext.define('DemoClient.Application', {  
          extend: 'Ext.app.Application',       
          name: 'DemoClient',  
          stores: [  
               'Users'  
          ],  
          //Add Sencha Inspector init to launch function  
          launch: function () {  
               // <debug>  
                    SenchaInspector.init('http://MyComputerName:1839');
                    // URL needs to match what you defined in app.json
               // </debug>  
          }  
      });
Notice that we’re wrapping the call to init() inside debug flags. Sencha Cmd will ignore all code between the debug blocks during a production build.
