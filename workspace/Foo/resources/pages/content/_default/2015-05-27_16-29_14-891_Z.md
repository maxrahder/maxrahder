The *ext-* and *sencha-* prefixes for various packages have been removed. This affects
how you refer to packages in `app.json`, or in any situation where you use those packages.

- *sencha-charts* is now *charts*
- *ext-theme-neptune* is now *theme-neptune*
- Etc.


Another change is that *all* classes in the +Ext.ux+ package have been moved to the *ux* package.
Previously, many +Ext.ux+ classes were included in the normal library.
