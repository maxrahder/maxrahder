There are two philosophies when it comes to creating objects: 
_procedural_ and _declarative_

<div type="expander" caption="Procedural" class="x-hidden">The procedural approach starts 
with creating the object, then running various setters on it to set the object's state.</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Declarative" class="x-hidden">
<p>
In the declarative approach, you 
<em>describe</em> the object as you create it.
</p><p>
Philosophically, the delclarative approach is preferred because it's more abstract &mdash;
your code describes *what* the object should be, but not *how* it's accomplished.
