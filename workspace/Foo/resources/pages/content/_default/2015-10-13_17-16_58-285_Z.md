#Introduction

In the last lab, you tested your code by running +setActiveItem()+ on the umbrella view.
That's poor encapsulation, because it only works because we know the internal details
of the +Umbrella.view.Umbrella+ class. We know it uses card layout (and therefore, 
+setActiveItem()+ works) and we know the IDs of the items. 

Instead, we should be thinking of the class in terms of doing class modeling. 

<img src="resources/images/umbrella/UmbrellaUml.jpg">

A well encapsulated version of +Umbrella+ has a property *rainy*, accessed via
set and get methods.

When rainy is set to true or false, the class takes care of updating its user interface.
Code outside of the class shouldn't know anything about the implementation details.

??Create a <i>rainy</i> property

Edit `modern/src/view/Umbrella.js` and add a config for *rainy*, initialized to null.

    config: {
        rainy: null
    }

Within +Umbrella+ we want to detect changes to *rainy*, and update the UI accordingly.

Save and refresh, and if you get a reference to the +Umbrella+ instance you'll see that there are 
+setRainy()+ and +getRainy()+ methods. They don't do anything yet.

??Add the update method

When a setter is run, two other methods are also run &mdash; an *apply* method used for
business rules or to transform the data, and an *update* method used for side-effects, like
updating the user interface.

Edit `modern/src/view/Umbrella.js` and add an +updateRainy+ method, with one parameter, *rainy*.

- If *rainy* is true, show the open umbrella and set the title to *Take Your Umbrella*
- If *rainy* it false, show the closed umbrella and set the title to *Leave Your Umbrella*


??Test the <code>updateRainy</code> method

Save and refresh. Then, on the command line try out the new method:

    var umbrella = Ext.first('umbrella');

    umbrella.setRainy(true); // The umbrella should be open
    
    umbrella.setRainy(false); // The umbrella should be closed
    
??Here's the code

If you'd like, compare your implementation of +Umbrella.view.Umbrella+ with this:

<pre class="runnable readonly">
Ext.define('Umbrella.view.Umbrella', {
    extend: 'Ext.Container',
    xtype: 'umbrella',
    requires: [
        'Ext.Img',
        'Ext.LoadMask',
        'Ext.TitleBar'
    ],
    config: {
        rainy: null
    },
    updateRainy: function(rainy) {
        if (rainy) {
            this.setActiveItem('#open');
            this.down('#title').setTitle('Take Your Umbrella');
        } else {
            this.setActiveItem('#closed');
            this.down('#title').setTitle('Leave Your Umbrella');
        }
    },
    layout: 'card',
    items: [{
        xtype: 'container',
        html: 'load mask',
        masked: {
            xtype: 'loadmask',
            message: 'Checking the weather...'
        }
    }, {
        xtype: 'image',
        src: 'modern/resources/images/OpenUmbrella.jpg',
        itemId: 'open'
    }, {
        xtype: 'image',
        src: 'modern/resources/images/ClosedUmbrella.jpg',
        itemId: 'closed'
    }, {
        xtype: 'titlebar',
        docked: 'top',
        itemId: 'title'
    }]
});
</pre>
