Declarations outside of any function are global. Otherwise, scope is *function-level*.
In other words, JavaScript does not have block-level scope. There is only function-level scope.

There are a couple of exceptions to that rule:
- A +catch+ block has its own scope
- In JavaScript version 6, a +let+ variable is scoped from point of declaration to the end of the encompassing block. Currently, +let+ is only allowed in strict mode.
