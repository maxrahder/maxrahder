Sass files need to be compiled into `css`. Historically, that was done via an open-source
program called *Compass*. *Fashion* is the name of Sencha's pure JavaScript Sass compiler. 
There are several benefits of using Fashion:

<div type="expander" caption="No Ruby Dependency">
The Sencha build proccess runs Compass to generate the CSS needed at runtime. 
Compass requires Ruby, so in previous versions of Ext JS, you needed Ruby 
to do a build.
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="It's Quicker">
The Compass phase of builds was slow. Fashion is much quicker, which means 
builds are quicker and <kbd>sencha app watch</kbd> is more responsive. 
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Fashion Can Run in the Browser">
Sencha Inspector and Fashion provide tooling to edit SCSS for a running application.
This means you can edit SCSS variables and immediately see the effect.
