To use a paging scroller, you need to set +buffered: true+ 
on the store.

Ext JS automatically uses a +bufferedrenderer+ 
plugin with any grid associated with a buffered store.

As the user drags the scrollbar selector, the grid loads its store, 
setting the +page+ parameter to a value proportional to the position 
of the scroller.

The plugin fetches several pages for each +load()+. So 
scrolling up or down in the grid a little will _not_ result 
in an additional page request. If you scroll past the buffered pages, 
the store requests a new set of pages.
