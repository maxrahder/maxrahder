Test-driven programming (or test-driven development) is
the process of:
<ul>
<li>Writing a test against a class API
<li>Stubbing out the class methods and running the test &mdash; the test will fail
<li>Implementing the methods so that the test passes
<li>Repeat
</ul>
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="Benefits">

This approach has many benefits:
<ul>
<li>Code tends to be simpler, since the goal is to pass the test
<li>It avoids implementing extraneous features
<li>The code is actually tested
<li>Regression testing is simple
<li>The test constitutes a specification
</ul>
