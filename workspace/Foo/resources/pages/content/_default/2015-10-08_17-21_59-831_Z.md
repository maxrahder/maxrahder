#Introduction

Both the classic and modern views would look better if the data were sorted. 
In addition, it would be nice to have the modern use the +grouped:true+
feature. 

That means you need to add a common view model feature used by both views. 
And another view model feature only used by the modern view.

??Sort the data

Edit `app/view/main/BaseModel.js` and sort the store on artist and song title:

    tunes: {
        model: 'Tunes.model.Tune',
        autoLoad: true,
        sorters: ['artist', 'title']
    }

Save and refresh, then run the modern version of the app to see how it looks.

Then run it as a classic app and verify that the sorting is in effect there too.

??Improve the artists sorting

The artist name sort is a little poor, because artists with names like *The Beatles*
will sort as starting with the letter T, rather than the letter B. It would be best
to see the name of the group, but sort on the name with the article *The* removed.
To do that, you can add a new field *sortArtist* to the record definition, and sort
on that. But the normal artist name will appear in lists.

Edit `app/model/Tune.js` and add a new field to the +fields+ array:

    {
        name: 'sortArtist',
        calculate: function(data) {
            var result = data.artist.toLowerCase();
            result = result.replace(/[^a-z0-9\s]/gi, ''); // Strip off non-alphanumerics.
            if (result.startsWith('the ')) {
                return result.substr(4);
            } else {
                return result;
            }
        }
    }

Now edit `app/view/main/BaseModel.js` and change the sorter to use *sortArtist*.
Save and refresh. 

Depending on whether there's a group starting with *The*, you should see the
*sortArtist* sorting in effect. Look for *The Beatles* or *The Weeknd*.

??Create a chained store

To have the grouping only affect the modern view, you'll create a chained store, then
add a grouper to it. 

Edit `modern/src/view/main/MainModel.js` with this code:

<pre class="runnable readonly 300">
Ext.define('Tunes.view.main.MainModel', {
    extend: 'Tunes.view.main.BaseModel',
    alias: 'viewmodel.main-main',
    stores: {
        tunesGrouped: {
            source: '{tunes}',
            grouper: {
                groupFn: function(record) {
                    return record.data.sortArtist[0].toUpperCase();
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
</pre>


??Have the list use the new store

Edit `modern/src/view/View.js` and add the config +grouped:true+.

Then, edit `modern/src/view/main/Main.js` and change the list's store
to *{tunesGrouped}*.

Save and refresh, and you should see the grouping in effect. <tt>:-)</tt>
