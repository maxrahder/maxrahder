#Introduction
 
In this lab you'll create a universal starter application and review its structure.

#Steps

??Generate the starter application

In the terminal window go to the `SenchaTraining/labs/ext/` folder and type this statement:

    sencha generate app Universal ../universal


??Run the application

Now use your Web browser to visit the new application. You'll see the starter app.

By default, the application runs as a classic app. If you turn on mobile phone emulation
it runs as a modern app.

You can also add `?classic` or `?modern` to explicitly run the classic or modern version.

??Look at the folder structure

There are `app`, `classic` and `modern` folders. The `classic` and `modern` folders are 
structured like a code package, with `src` and `sass` folders. 

??Look at `app/view/main/Main.js`

The main view is a tab panel. Like the classic version, there's a lot of binding. Touch does
not have the bindable mixin, but Modern does.

There's no responsive code because the responsive plugin and mixin are not yet part of modern.

Like the classic app, most of the tabs simply show *lorem ipsum* text. The application also
has a grid, and it also creates a store via an alias. 


??Look at `app/Application.js`

This is structured like the classic app, and uses the +onAppUpdate+ method. 

??Look at `app.js`

This is also structured like the classic app, and uses +mainView+.
