To show ISS passes, you'll need a *store*, a *record* and a *dataview*.

- An +Ext.data.Store+ is a collection of records. A record describes the data
in the feed, with syntax to convert values if needed.

- An +Ext.dataview.Dataview+ is a component that renders an HTML snippet for each record in a store.


The data comes from the Open Notify *ISS pass times* feed.
