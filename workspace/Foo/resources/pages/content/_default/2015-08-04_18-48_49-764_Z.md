#Introduction

In this lab, you will try out the most commonly used Google Developer Tools debugger
features: Sources, Network and Console.

The lab is written assuming you are using Chrome. Other debuggers, such as Firefox's FireBug have
similar features, but if you are using something other than Chrome, you will have to figure out the
corresponding feature. Obviously, we haven't covered any Ext JS concepts or syntax yet, so don't
worry about the details of the code. Instead, focus on the features of the debugger.

#Steps

??Start the server

To start the server, with the document root at `SenchaTraining`:

- Use a terminal window to navigate to `SenchaTraining`
- Make sure the server isn't already running, by entering `sencha web stop`
- Then start the server by entering `sencha web start`
- The terminal window is used for the server, so leave it open and running.

??Get the starter code

Download <a href="resources/student/labs/debugging.zip">debugging.zip</a> and unzip it into
your `SenchaTraining/labs` folder. When you are finished your `SenchaTraining` folder should look like this:

    SenchaTraining
        ext-6
        labs
            debugging


??Run the sample application

In your web browser, navigate to `labs/debugging`. It's a simple application
with a viewport, a grid, a store and a record definition (model). The
grid has a toolbar with a button. Click on the button and you'll see an alert.

??Open the Google Developer Tools debugger

Open your browser's debugger. For chrome, that's done via the menu option View | Developer | Developer Tools.
Note the shortcut key for opening the debugger &mdash; you'll be using the debugger so frequently, the
shortcut key will come in handy.

??Review the debugger's layout

Note that the Chrome debugger has the sections *Network*, used to see network traffic,
*Sources*, for seeing loaded JavaScript files and *Console*, for entering JavaScript statements.

There are other sections: Elements, Timeline, Profiles, Resources, and Audits.
Elements can be informative when using templates, covered later in class.
The other sections are used much less often.

??Look at the debugger Sources tab

Note that all the JavaScript sources in our application are shown, grouped by path.

<img src="resources/images/labs/debugging/Sources.png">

??Set a break point

In Sources, select `app/view/beatles/Grid.js` and set a break point on the statement
showing the alert &mdash; it's the statement that reads +Ext.Msg.alert(button.getText(), 'Yeah yeah yeah!');+.

Breakpoints are set by clicking on the source code line number. Line numbers with breakpoints are highlighted in blue.

<img src="resources/images/labs/debugging/SetBreakpoint.png">

Click on the "She loves you..." button, and execution stops on the break point.

On the right of Sources is a section titled "Watch Expressions". There's a + button on its toolbar
that lets you watch (evaluate) expressions when you're in the debugger.

<img src="resources/images/labs/debugging/HittingBreakpoint.png">

Press \+ and add the watch expression +this.$className+. Any object created using Sencha's class system
has this property, which holds the name of the current object's class. This is handy to verify what
class you're in, and the scope of function calls. If you're stopped on the breakpoint you just created
you should see Ext.button.Button as the value of +this.$className+. That means the function is being run
in the context of a button.

Press \+ and add another watch expression: +arguments+. Arguments is an object automatically created by
JavaScript. It holds all the parameters passed to a function. If you click on "She loves you..." again and
look at the arguments watch expression, you'll see that two parameters were passed to the function. If
you were to inspect them, you'd find that they are the button that fired the event, and an event object,
describing things such as the mouse coordinates and whether a special key was pressed.

??Use the debugger console

Note that Chrome has a separate console section, and in addition a small console section can be shown
anywhere in the debugger via the "Drawer" toolbar button.

Click on the drawer button to show the console drawer in the Sources section.
Then press "She loves you..." again to hit your break point. If you then go to the console,
you can run any JavaScript statement you want, scoped at the break point.

<img src="resources/images/labs/debugging/Drawer.png">

On the console type +arguments[0].$className;+ and you'll see Ext.button.Button. This works because +arguments+
is a local variable that exists at your breakpoint.

On the console press the up arrow on your keyboard &mdash; Chrome keeps a history of what you've typed,
accessed via up and down arrow.

Change the console statement to look at the second argument: +arguments[1].$className;+ and you'll see Ext.event.Event.

Note that you can run *any statement you'd like*. Try entering +button.setText('Hi there!');+ and you'll see
the button's caption change! The code works because button is the local variable holding the reference to the
"She loves me..." button. Button objects have a +setText()+ method used to set the caption.

In this way, you can run any statement and any method of any object in scope. You can also run methods in your own
classes. *This is an important concept*. It means you can use the console for a lot more than setting breakpoints.
You can also use it to test your application's API.

The console drawer takes up space, so it's a good habit to close it when you aren't using it.

Now refresh the browser, and click on the "She loves you..." button again. You'll see the alert, but you do 
won't hit your breakpoint! This is because when fetching files, the Sencha class loader adds a "no cache" parameter 
to the URL for the file. That's done to guarantee that you get a fresh copy of everything as you make changes to your 
code. The breakpoint is lost because from the perspective of the browser the URL is different, so it assumes it's 
a different file altogether, and whatever breakpoints you used for the previous URL are no longer relevant.

??Use your IDE to inspect the application

In your IDE look at the `labs/debugging` directory. Note that the file structure is the
same as what you saw in the Sources section of the debugger. There are nine source files:
- `app/model/Person.js`
- `app/view/beatles/Grid.js`
- `app/view/beatles/GridModel.js`
- `app/view/beatles/GridController.js`
- `app/view/main/Main.js`
- `app/view/main/MainModel.js`
- `app/view/main/MainController.js`
- `app/Application.js`
- `app.js`

When you run the app, program execution starts in `app.js`. That file was automatically created by Sencha when
the application was first generated. It contains the +Ext.application()+ statement which is the starting point
for all Ext applications. The code names the application, and created the top-level view, which is an instance 
of +Beatles.view.main.Main+.

+Beatles.view.main.Main+ is a panel, with an associated view controller and view model. The main view contains
a single child &mdash; a +Beatles.view.beatles.Grid+, which is created via the grid's alias *beatles-grid*. The
main controller and view model could be used to hold program logic and bindable data, but in this case, they are
essentially empty.

+Beatles.view.beatles.Grid+ is a grid, with an associated view controller and view model. The grid uses a store
named +{people}+, which is defined in +Beatles.view.beatles.GridModel+. The grid also has a toolbar with the
*She loves you...* button and click handler. 

+Beatles.view.beatles.GridModel+ creates the +{people}+ store, which holds records of type +Beatles.model.Person+.


??Try +Ext.first()+ and +Ext.all()+

+Ext.first()+ and +Ext.all()+ are methods that help with debugging. (It's unlikely you'd use them in your application code.)
These are convenience methods that run +Ext.ComponentQuery.query()+, and return the first or all occurances of components
that match the passed query string. Component queries can be complex, but normally you simply pass an component alias (xtype)
or +itemId+. 

In the browser window running the application, use the command line and enter 

    Ext.first('beatles-grid');
    
This statement returns the first object with the specified xtype, which in this case is the first &mdash; and only &mdash; 
instance of the grid. 

Chrome gives you crude code completion via introspection. For example, enter this:

    var grid = Ext.first('beatles-grid');

First, you'll see that the statement evaluates to *undefined*. Which is confusing. The variable *grid* does gets initialized, 
but according to the semantics of JavaScript, the variable statement as a whole evaluates to undefined. 

Now start typeing *grid* followed by a dot, and pause. You should see a list of all properties (including methods) associated
with *grid*.

<img src="resources/images/labs/debugging/CodeComplete.jpg"/>


Now try typing `Ext.first('beatles-grid').` followed by a dot, and pause. Nothing happens! That's because the debugger
has no way of knowing what will be returned by the function. (Remember &mdash; JavaScript functions and variables are
un-typed.) You're free to run methods and chain them, but you only get code-completion when you are using an object.

Here are a couple of ways to get a reference to a store: 

    Ext.first('beatles-grid').getStore(); // Returns the grid's store
    Ext.first('beatles-grid').getViewModel().getStore('people'); // Returns the view model's store (which should be what the grid is using)

Now try this:

    Ext.all('button'); 
    
This returns *five* buttons! Four are the buttons used in the +Ext.Msg+ singleton, and the other is the *She loves you...* button.
If you look at the source in `app/view/beatles/Grid.js`, you'll see that the button has +itemId:'sheLovesMe'+. To select an item
using an ID, use the # mark:

    Ext.first('#sheLovesMe'); // Returns the component with id or itemId of sheLovesMe
    
You could also have looked for the button within its continer. For example, try this:

    Ext.first('panel toolbar button'); // Returns the first button within a toolbar within a panel

You'd think this would match the *She loves me...* button, but it actually matches one of the +Ext.Msg+ buttons. You
can confirm that by running +getText()+ on the component.

    Ext.first('panel toolbar button').getText(); // Returns "OK" (the text of one of the Ext.Msg buttons)

To get the button in the Beatles app, you can narrow it down by using a more specific alias. Such as *grid*
(matching *any* grid or grid sub-class) or *beatles-grid* (matching the specific alias/xtype defined in 
+Beatles.view.beatles.Grid+.

    Ext.first('grid button').getText(); // Returns "She loves me..."
    Ext.first('beatles-grid button').getText(); // Returns "She loves me..."
    

In summary, +Ext.first()+ and +Ext.all()+ are handy for debugging. They take a component query, documented in
the API docs under +Ext.ComponentQuery.query()+, that typically matches using a component xtype or +itemId+.



??Break something

Edit `labs/debugging/app/view/beatles/GridModel.js` and comment out the stores config.

In JavaScript, a double-slash comments out the rest of a line of code, so just put a double
slash at the start of the statements.
<pre>
Ext.define('Beatles.view.beatles.GridModel', {
    extend: 'Ext.app.ViewModel',    
    alias: 'viewmodel.beatles-grid',

    requires: ['Beatles.model.Person'],

    // stores: {
    //     people: {
    //     	model: 'Beatles.model.Person',
    //     	autoLoad: true
    //     }
    // }

});
</pre>

Save your change, switch over to your browser and refresh the page. Since we are no longer using a store, the grid is empty.

??Use the console to get a reference to a store

Our application is running, but there's no data in the grid. If this were a bug you'd have
to ask yourself a few questions: Does the store exist? Does it have data? If not, is the
code actually fetching data from the backend? Maybe the record definition doesn't match
what's being sent from the backend?

So when debugging a situation like this, you'd want to look at the store. Try entering this: 

    Ext.first('beatles-grid').getStore(); // Returns a store

That's strange, since we commented out the store. Try this:

    Ext.first('beatles-grid').getViewModel().getStore('people'); // Returns null

That shows that there is no store in the view model. So what's the store on the grid? It's an empty 
store provided by Ext JS. Components that use stores often require a store initially, and until you
provide one, they default to the empty store. Run this:

    Ext.first('beatles-grid').getStore().getStoreId(); // Returns "ext-empty-store"

So when looking at stores, sometimes it's best to look at the the copy in the view model. Or &mdash;
if you look at the store on the component &mdash; make sure it's not the framework's empty store.

Re-edit `labs/debugging/app/view/beatles/GridModel.js`, and remove the comments for the store. Then
save and refresh your browser to confirm that the grid shows data, and things are back to normal.


??Look at network traffic

If a store exists, but is empty, it may never have been loaded. Or perhaps there's something
wrong with the record definition. 

To see the data being fetched, go to the debugger's Network section. By default it shows all
the files being fetched by your application: scripts, CSS files, images and XHR requests.
Chrome has a "Filter" toolbar button in the Network section that lets you see only a specific
type of traffic:

Filter on XHR calls. That will show the AJAX calls used to populate stores. Look for the call to `theBeatles.json`.
Select it, and to the right you can look at the request, including query data and headers, and the response. For some
data, "Preview" shows a formatted version of the response. Looking at network responses is a great way to confirm that
you are fetching the data you expect.

<img src="resources/images/labs/debugging/NetworkTraffic.png">

??See what happens when the store is there, but the URL is wrong

Edit `labs/debugging/app/model/Person.js`, and modify the proxy to use a bad
URL: +url:'XXXresources/data/theBeatles.json'+. Save your change, and refresh your browser.

Look at the Network section, and you'll see the server responded with a 404 (not found). You'll
also see a similar message on the Console, because the AJAX call threw an exception.

On the console re-enter +Ext.first('beatles-grid').getViewModel().getStore('people')+. (Remember,
chrome's console remembers what you've typed in the past, so if you press up-arrow, Chrome shows
previously typed commands.)

This returns a reference to the store. Now get the store's record 
count: +Ext.first('beatles-grid').getViewModel().getStore('people').getCount()+

It returns 0, because the store was created, but failed to retreive data due to the bad URL.


??See what happens if the store isn't loaded

Use your IDE to open `labs/debugging/app/view/beatles/GridModel.js` and comment out the +autoLoad:true+. Commenting this out means the
store won't be loaded at all. Save your change, and refresh the browser.

You'll no longer have a 404, because the call to the backend was never made.
+Ext.first('beatles-grid').getViewModel().getStore('people').getCount()+ still returns 0, showing that the store 
exists, but is empty.

??Un-do the bad code

Now edit `labs/debugging/app/model/Person.js` again, and fix the proxy URL. Also edit
`labs/debugging/app/view/beatles/GridModel.js` and remove the comment around the autoLoad statement.
Save and refresh, and verify that things work again.
