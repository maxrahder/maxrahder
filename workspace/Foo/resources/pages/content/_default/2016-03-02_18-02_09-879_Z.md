The Marx Brothers were a family comedy act that was successful in vaudeville, on 
Broadway, and in motion pictures from 1905 to 1949. They made thirteen feature files,
many of which were selected by the American Film Institute (AFI) as among the top 100 
comedy films.

The group are almost universally known by their stage names: Chico, Harpo, Groucho, 
Gummo, and Zeppo Marx. The core of the act was the three elder brothers: Chico, Harpo, 
and Groucho. Each developed a highly distinctive stage persona.
