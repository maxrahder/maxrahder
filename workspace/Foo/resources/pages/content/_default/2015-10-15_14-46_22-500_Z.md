The response passed to the success or failure callback is of type +XMLHttpRequest+ (XHR),
which is a native DOM type, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/dom/dom_http.asp" target="_blank">documented at W3 Schools</a>, and other places.

The XHR object has a few key properties:

<div type="expander" caption="status">
The response HTTP status, such as 200 (OK) or 404 (not found).
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="responseText">
The string response. You'll typically code your server
to return a JSON string <em>which then needs to be parsed</em>.
</div>

<div type="expander" caption="responseXml">
A DOM object, which is the parsed XML response. This property is only filled if the server sets the response 
MIME type appropriately.
</div>
