The build process is driven by your view classes. For every view class, 
the build process looks for a corresponding `.scss` file to process.


In this example, since there is an `Application.js` and `view/main/Main.js`, the
corresponding `Application.scss` and `view/main/Main.scss` files are processed.
Since there is *not* a `Foo.js` file, the `Foo.scss` file is not processed.

        Application.js

            main/
                Main.js

        src/
            Application.scss
            view/
                main/
                    Main.scss
            Foo.scss 
        var/
            Application.scss
            view/
                main/
                    Main.scss
            Foo.scss
