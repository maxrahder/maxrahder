#Introduction
 
Warning: This is a long lab! 

In this lab you'll refactor YelpExtplorer to be a universal version 6 app. And you'll 
add a *modern* view. Both the *classic* and *modern* views will share control logic
and view model properties and stores.

Throughout the lab you'll need to use `sencha app refresh` frequently so the *bootstrap* 
microloader keeps track of where classes are, as you move them from `classic` to the 
shared `app` folder. Any time you add, move or rename a class, run `sencha app refresh`

#Steps

??Make sure +sencha app watch+ is no longer running

You no longer need +sencha app watch+, so if it's still running cancel out. Typically,
that's done by going to the terminal window running *watch*, and pressing `Ctrl-c`.

Then start the server by using the terminal window to navigate to `SenchaTraining/labs` directory 
and running

    sencha web start

??Get the starter app

You instructor will give you a copy of `yelpextplorer` and `shared` folders. 
Place them in `SenchaTraining/labs`.

The `shared` folder is the same as the one you used throughout the week. The `yelpextplorer`
folder holds the final YelpExtplorer app, but with the source code in the `classic/src` 
folder instead of in the `app` folder. 

These files are provided to save you the time and trouble of copying those from 
the `ExtJS_5/labs` folder to the `ExtJS_6` folder.

??Generate a new universal YelpExtplorer app

Open a terminal window and navigate to `SenchaTraining/labs/ext` and
generate a new universal app
    
    sencha generate app YelpExtplorer ../yelpextplorer

??Clear out some of the generated code

In the file system:

- Delete `yelpextplorer/classic`
- Rename `yelpextplorer/classic_save` to `yelpextplorer/classic`

Do *not* rename the `modern_save` folder yet. You'll do that later in the lab.

Now edit `yelpextplorer/modern/src/view/main/Main.js` and replace its contents with this code:

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.Main', {
        extend: 'Ext.tab.Panel',
        xtype: 'app-main'
    });

And finally, delete `yelpextplorer/modern/src/view/main/List.js`

??Refresh the app

Use a terminal window and navigate to `SenchaTraining/ExtJS_6/yelpextplorer` and enter

    sencha app refresh

Run the app in your Web browser. It should work like it did before.

??Review `app.json`

Look at `app.json` +requires+ array . It has entries for *charts* and *ux*. 
Note that the package names no longer have the *ext* or *sencha* prefixes, because 
in version 6 the libary is unified, and the packages are shared by both toolkits.

Look at the `app.json` classpath entry. It includes an entry for the toolkit `src` 
folder, the `app` folder, and the `shared` folder that holds +Shared.view.Map+.

??Review the `app` folder

Look at the `app` folder. In a version 5, or a non-universal version 6 app, the 
`app` folder holds the application source code. In a universal app it holds code 
shared by both the classic and modern views. 

Initially, your `app` folder is the one generated in the starter app, but soon you'll 
refactor it to put shared code there, such as +YelpExtplorer.model.Business+, and a 
view controller and view model.

??Move the controller to `app`

Most of the controller logic needs to be shared between the classic and modern views.

As a first step, copy the entire contents of `yelpextplorer/classic/src/view/main/MainController.js`
and, with them, completely replace the contents of `yelpextplorer/app/view/main/MainController.js`'. Then to make sure the classic copy is no longer used, 
rename the controller in `classic` to `MainController_save.js`. 

Save your changes and refresh your Web browser. You'll see an error that the `Routes.js` file isn't 
found by the loader. That's because classes in the `app` folder only load classes within `app`. 

In theory, you could move `Routes.js` to `app`. But that code isn't common &mdash; the routing logic
relates to the view, and the classic and modern views are too different to share that logic. 
Therefore, you need to refactor the application to share some control logic, but still have some
control logic in the view. You'll do the refactoring in the next step.

??Move the routing logic to the *classic* view

The goal is to separate the common control logic from the class-view-specific control logic.
To do this, you need to end up with *two* controllers &mdash; one that's common to both the
classic and modern views, and one that performs logic specific to the classic view.

Start by renaming `yelpextplorer/app/view/main/MainController.js` to `yelpextplorer/app/view/main/MainControllerShared.js`. 
Change its classname in the +Ext.define()+. Remove its +alias+ and +mixins+ configs. 

Then go back to `yelpextplorer/classic/src/view/main` and rename `MainController_save.js` back to `MainController.js`. 
Remove all its configs and methods *except* for the +routes+ config. Have it extend the new shared 
controller.

As a result it will end up looking like this:

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainController', {
        extend: 'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainControllerShared',
        alias: 'controller.main',
        mixins: ['YelpExtplorer.view.main.Routes'],
        
        routes: {
            '!:tab': 'processRoute',
            '!:tab/:city': 'processRoute',
            '!:tab/:city/:category': 'processRoute'
        }
    });

If you save your changes and refresh the Web browser, the app should work again. If you look 
at Network traffic you'll see that both the `classic` and `app` controllers are being loaded.

But you aren't quite finished. The shared controller is still calling routines in `Routes.js` &mdash;
a shared controller shouldn't be referencing methods in the classic view. 

Edit `yelpextplorer/classic/src/view/main/MainController.js` and add an +initViewModel+ method:

    initViewModel: function(vm) {
        var me = this;
        this.callParent(arguments);
        vm.bind('{city}', me.updateHash, me);
        vm.bind('{category}', me.updateHash, me);
    }

Note that the method calls the +initViewModel+ method in the ancestor (shared) controller. And
the statements that call +YelpExtplorer.main.view.Routes#updateHash+ are done. It's appropriate
for a classic-scoped view controller to reference classic methods.

Now edit `MainControllerShared.js` and *remove* the two statements that run +updateHash+.

??Move common view code to the shared folder

The shared view controller is referencing and updating view model properties that need to
be shared between the classic and modern views. For example, the *businesses* store, 
*location* and other view model properties need to be shared.

Copy the contents of `yelpextplorer/classic/src/view/main/MainModel.js` and use them to completely replace the contents of `yelpextplorer/app/view/main/MainModel.js`. 
Rename `app/view/main.MainModel.js` to `MainModelShared.js`. Also change the class name in the
+Ext.define()+, and remove the alias.

Then edit `yelpextplorer/classic/src/view/main/MainModel.js` and replace its contents with this:

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel', {
        extend: 'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModelShared',
        alias: 'viewmodel.main'
    });

Since the shared view model now has the +requires:['YelpExtplorer.model.Business']+, the record
class also needs to be in the `app` folder. In the file system, move `yelpextplorer/classic/src/model/Business.js`
to `yelpextplorer/app/model`.

Save and refresh, and the app should still work. 

??Move view model code relating to classic back to the classic folder

You moved the main view model entirely to the shared view model. 
But that means the shared view model includes the *ratingCounts* store &mdash;
that's only needed by the `classic` user interface. Therefore, cut (and remove)
the *ratingCounts* config from `yelpextplorer/app/view/main/MainModelShared.js` and put it 
in a +stores+ config in `yelpextplorer/classic/src/view/main/MainModel.js`.

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModel', {
        extend: 'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainModelShared',
        alias: 'viewmodel.main',
        
        stores: {
            ratingCounts: {
                type: 'array',
                fields: ['rating', 'count']
            }
        }
    
     });

Save and refresh, and the app should still work. The key difference here is that the store is 
more correctly defined in the `classic` view, and not in the shared view model.

But the shared view controller is still updating the *ratingCounts* store &mdash; that should 
really be done in the view controller in `classic`.

Cut (and remove) the +onBusinessesRefresh+ method from `yelpextplorer/app/view/main/MainControllerShared.js` 
and paste it to `yelpextplorer/classic/src/view/main/MainController.js`. 

    Ext.define('YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainController', {
        extend: 'YelpExtplorer.view.main.MainControllerShared',
        alias: 'controller.main',
        mixins: ['YelpExtplorer.view.main.Routes'],
        routes: {
            '!:tab': 'processRoute',
            '!:tab/:city': 'processRoute',
            '!:tab/:city/:category': 'processRoute'
        },
        initViewModel: function(vm) {
            var me = this;
            this.callParent(arguments);
            vm.bind('{city}', me.updateHash, me);
            vm.bind('{category}', me.updateHash, me);
        },
        onBusinessesRefresh: function(store) {
            var rawData = {};
            store.each(function(business) {
                var rating = business.data.rating.toString();
                rawData[rating] = rawData[rating] || 0;
                rawData[rating]++;
            });
            var data = [];
            Ext.Array.forEach(["1", "1.5", "2", "2.5", "3", "3.5", "4", "4.5", "5"], function(item) {
                data.push([item, (rawData[item] || 0)]);
            });
            this.getStore('ratingCounts').setData(data);
        }
    });

Save and refresh, and everything should work.

But there's still one last bad dependency in the shared code &mdash; the config for the *businesses* store
has a load listener that runs +onBusinessesRefresh+. That should be done from within the classic view, 
not from the shared logic. Therefore, add this statement to `yelpextplorer/classic/src/view/main/MainController.js`
+initViewModel+ method: 

    vm.getStore('businesses').on('refresh', this.onBusinessesRefresh, me);

Then edit `yelpextplorer/app/view/main/MainModelShared.js` and remove the +listener+ config in the *businesses* store.

??Add modern user interface

The code for the modern UI is in `modern_save`. 

Delete the `yelpextplorer/modern` folder, and rename `modern_save` to `modern`.


??Run the modern UI

Save and refresh. You should see the classic UI, as usual. But if you select the Toggle Device button to
turn on mobile emulation, and refresh, you should see the mobile version! 

Note that when doing mobile development it's sometimes nice to dock the debugger to the right.

??Review the modern UI main view

The code for the modern view is beyond the scope of this class, but your instructor can point out a few things.

The +YelpExtplorer.view.main.Main+ class name matches the name in the classic view. At run-time, 
the framework chooses one or the other starting point, depending on what's returned by the +Ext.beforeLoad+
in `index.html`.

The main view extends +Ext.navigation.View+. A navigation view is a container that uses
card layout organized as a stack. A child item is added by running +push()+. The pushed 
child becomes the current card, and a Back button is automatically added to the toolbar. 
Pressing Back pops the child from the stack of children, and whatever card is at the top of 
the stack is then shown to the user.

The navigation view starts with a single child, a tab panel. 

??Review the modern UI tab panel

The tab panel has two items: a map and a list.

Open `modern/src/view/businesses/TabPanel.js` and look at the config for the map and list.
Each is bound to the *{businesses}* store and *{business}* record, just just like the classic UI. 
These properties are in the shared view model.

There's also a filter panel, with text fields for city and category. These are bound to the shared 
view model *{typedCity}* and *{typedCategory}* properties, just like the classic view.

Note that the map's selection is bound to *{business}*. 
In theory, the list should have the same binding, but in the beta release of Ext JS 6, 
+Ext.dataview.List+ doesn't publish *selection*. 
So the code uses a custom property *business* for the binding &mdash; if you look at the code for the 
list class, you will see how that property is set up and published.


#Conclusion

In this lab you migrated your Ext JS 5.x application to Ext JS 6. 
The new application has a *modern* user interface and controllers, and
view models are shared.
